      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My father’s family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my\n",
      "infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit\n",
      "than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.\n",
      "\n",
      "I give Pirrip as my father’s family name, on the authority of his\n",
      "tombstone and my sister,—Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.\n",
      "As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of\n",
      "either of them (for their days were long before the days of\n",
      "photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were\n",
      "unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on\n",
      "my father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,\n",
      "with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,\n",
      "“_Also Georgiana Wife of the Above_,” I drew a childish conclusion that\n",
      "my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each\n",
      "about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside\n",
      "their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of\n",
      "mine,—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that\n",
      "universal struggle,—I am indebted for a belief I religiously\n",
      "entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands\n",
      "in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state\n",
      "of existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river\n",
      "wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad\n",
      "impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on\n",
      "a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out\n",
      "for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the\n",
      "churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also\n",
      "Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander,\n",
      "Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the\n",
      "aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness\n",
      "beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates,\n",
      "with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low\n",
      "leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from\n",
      "which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of\n",
      "shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from\n",
      "among the graves at the side of the church porch. “Keep still, you\n",
      "little devil, or I’ll cut your throat!”\n",
      "\n",
      "A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man\n",
      "with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his\n",
      "head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and\n",
      "lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by\n",
      "briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose\n",
      "teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Don’t cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded in terror. “Pray don’t do it,\n",
      "sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell us your name!” said the man. “Quick!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pip, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once more,” said the man, staring at me. “Give it mouth!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pip. Pip, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Show us where you live,” said the man. “Pint out the place!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the\n",
      "alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and\n",
      "emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.\n",
      "When the church came to itself,—for he was so sudden and strong that he\n",
      "made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my\n",
      "feet,—when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high\n",
      "tombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration]\n",
      "\n",
      "“You young dog,” said the man, licking his lips, “what fat cheeks you\n",
      "ha’ got.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my\n",
      "years, and not strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Darn me if I couldn’t eat ’em,” said the man, with a threatening shake\n",
      "of his head, “and if I han’t half a mind to’t!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn’t, and held tighter to the\n",
      "tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;\n",
      "partly, to keep myself from crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now lookee here!” said the man. “Where’s your mother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, sir!” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, sir!” I timidly explained. “Also Georgiana. That’s my mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said he, coming back. “And is that your father alonger your\n",
      "mother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” said I; “him too; late of this parish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ha!” he muttered then, considering. “Who d’ye live with,—supposin’\n",
      "you’re kindly let to live, which I han’t made up my mind about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My sister, sir,—Mrs. Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,\n",
      "sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blacksmith, eh?” said he. And looked down at his leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "After darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to\n",
      "my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he\n",
      "could hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,\n",
      "and mine looked most helplessly up into his.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now lookee here,” he said, “the question being whether you’re to be\n",
      "let to live. You know what a file is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you know what wittles is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a\n",
      "greater sense of helplessness and danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You get me a file.” He tilted me again. “And you get me wittles.” He\n",
      "tilted me again. “You bring ’em both to me.” He tilted me again. “Or\n",
      "I’ll have your heart and liver out.” He tilted me again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both\n",
      "hands, and said, “If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,\n",
      "sir, perhaps I shouldn’t be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped\n",
      "over its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright\n",
      "position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You\n",
      "bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and\n",
      "you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your\n",
      "having seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall\n",
      "be let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no\n",
      "matter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore\n",
      "out, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain’t alone, as you may think I am.\n",
      "There’s a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I\n",
      "am a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man has\n",
      "a secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his\n",
      "heart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide\n",
      "himself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may be warm in\n",
      "bed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think\n",
      "himself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and\n",
      "creep his way to him and tear him open. I am a keeping that young man\n",
      "from harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I\n",
      "find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what\n",
      "do you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken\n",
      "bits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in\n",
      "the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say Lord strike you dead if you don’t!” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said so, and he took me down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” he pursued, “you remember what you’ve undertook, and you\n",
      "remember that young man, and you get home!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Goo-good night, sir,” I faltered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much of that!” said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. “I\n",
      "wish I was a frog. Or a eel!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his\n",
      "arms,—clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,—and limped\n",
      "towards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the\n",
      "nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked\n",
      "in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,\n",
      "stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his\n",
      "ankle and pull him in.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose\n",
      "legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When\n",
      "I saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of\n",
      "my legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on\n",
      "again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and\n",
      "picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into\n",
      "the marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were\n",
      "heavy or the tide was in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped\n",
      "to look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not\n",
      "nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long\n",
      "angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the\n",
      "river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the\n",
      "prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the\n",
      "beacon by which the sailors steered,—like an unhooped cask upon a\n",
      "pole,—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with\n",
      "some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was\n",
      "limping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,\n",
      "and come down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a\n",
      "terrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their\n",
      "heads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I\n",
      "looked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of\n",
      "him. But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.\n",

      "My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,\n",
      "and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours\n",
      "because she had brought me up “by hand.” Having at that time to find\n",
      "out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a\n",
      "hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her\n",
      "husband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both\n",
      "brought up by hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general\n",
      "impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe\n",
      "was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth\n",
      "face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to\n",
      "have somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,\n",
      "good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,—a sort\n",
      "of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing\n",
      "redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible\n",
      "she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall\n",
      "and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her\n",
      "figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in\n",
      "front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful\n",
      "merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this\n",
      "apron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn\n",
      "it at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken\n",
      "it off, every day of her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe’s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of\n",
      "the dwellings in our country were,—most of them, at that time. When I\n",
      "ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was\n",
      "sitting alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and\n",
      "having confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment\n",
      "I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,\n",
      "sitting in the chimney corner.\n",

      "“Is she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Pip,” said Joe; “and what’s worse, she’s got Tickler with her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat\n",
      "round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler\n",
      "was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled\n",
      "frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She sot down,” said Joe, “and she got up, and she made a grab at\n",
      "Tickler, and she Ram-paged out. That’s what she did,” said Joe, slowly\n",
      "clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at\n",
      "it; “she Ram-paged out, Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Has she been gone long, Joe?” I always treated him as a larger species\n",
      "of child, and as no more than my equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, “she’s been on the\n",
      "Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She’s a-coming! Get\n",
      "behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,\n",
      "and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause,\n",
      "and applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by\n",
      "throwing me—I often served as a connubial missile—at Joe, who, glad to\n",

      "fenced me up there with his great leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where have you been, you young monkey?” said Mrs. Joe, stamping her\n",
      "foot. “Tell me directly what you’ve been doing to wear me away with\n",
      "fret and fright and worrit, or I’d have you out of that corner if you\n",
      "was fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Churchyard!” repeated my sister. “If it warn’t for me you’d have been\n",

      "\n",
      "“You did,” said I.\n",

      "“And why did I do it, I should like to know?” exclaimed my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "I whimpered, “I don’t know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ don’t!” said my sister. “I’d never do it again! I know that. I may\n",
      "truly say I’ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.\n",
      "It’s bad enough to be a blacksmith’s wife (and him a Gargery) without\n",
      "being your mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at\n",
      "the fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the\n",
      "mysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was\n",
      "under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me\n",
      "in the avenging coals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. “Churchyard,\n",
      "indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.” One of us, by the by,\n",
      "had not said it at all. “You’ll drive _me_ to the churchyard betwixt\n",
      "you, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you’d be without\n",
      "me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me\n",
      "over his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and\n",
      "calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the\n",
      "grievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his\n",
      "right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with\n",
      "his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,\n",
      "that never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard\n",
      "and fast against her bib,—where it sometimes got a pin into it, and\n",
      "sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she\n",
      "took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,\n",
      "in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,—using\n",
      "both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and\n",
      "moulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a\n",
      "final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very\n",
      "thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the\n",
      "loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.\n",
      "I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful\n",
      "acquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew\n",
      "Mrs. Joe’s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my\n",
      "larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.\n",
      "Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of\n",
      "my trousers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I\n",
      "found to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap\n",
      "from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.\n",
      "And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In our\n",
      "already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his\n",
      "good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare\n",
      "the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each\n",
      "other’s admiration now and then,—which stimulated us to new exertions.\n",
      "To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast\n",
      "diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he\n",
      "found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my\n",
      "untouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately\n",
      "considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had\n",
      "best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the\n",
      "circumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at\n",
      "me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss\n",
      "of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he\n",
      "didn’t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than\n",
      "usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like\n",
      "a pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on\n",
      "one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw\n",
      "that my bread and butter was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of\n",
      "his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister’s\n",
      "observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s the matter _now_?” said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say, you know!” muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious\n",
      "remonstrance. “Pip, old chap! You’ll do yourself a mischief. It’ll\n",
      "stick somewhere. You can’t have chawed it, Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s the matter now?” repeated my sister, more sharply than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I’d recommend you to do\n",
      "it,” said Joe, all aghast. “Manners is manners, but still your elth’s\n",
      "your elth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,\n",
      "and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little\n",
      "while against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking\n",
      "guiltily on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, perhaps you’ll mention what’s the matter,” said my sister, out of\n",
      "breath, “you staring great stuck pig.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and\n",
      "looked at me again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know, Pip,” said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,\n",
      "and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,\n",
      "“you and me is always friends, and I’d be the last to tell upon you,\n",
      "any time. But such a—” he moved his chair and looked about the floor\n",
      "between us, and then again at me—“such a most oncommon Bolt as that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Been bolting his food, has he?” cried my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know, old chap,” said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,\n",
      "with his bite still in his cheek, “I Bolted, myself, when I was your\n",
      "age—frequent—and as a boy I’ve been among a many Bolters; but I never\n",
      "see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it’s a mercy you ain’t Bolted\n",
      "dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying\n",
      "nothing more than the awful words, “You come along and be dosed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine\n",
      "medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;\n",
      "having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the\n",
      "best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a\n",
      "choice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like\n",
      "a new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded\n",
      "a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater\n",
      "comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be\n",
      "held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to\n",
      "swallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and\n",
      "meditating before the fire), “because he had had a turn.” Judging from\n",
      "myself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had\n",
      "none before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in\n",
      "the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret\n",
      "burden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great\n",
      "punishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—I\n",
      "never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the\n",
      "housekeeping property as his—united to the necessity of always keeping\n",
      "one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about\n",
      "the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,\n",
      "as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the\n",
      "voice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to\n",
      "secrecy, declaring that he couldn’t and wouldn’t starve until\n",
      "to-morrow, but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the\n",
      "young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his\n",
      "hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should\n",
      "mistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart and\n",
      "liver to-night, instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody’s hair stood on\n",

      "It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with\n",
      "a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with\n",
      "the load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the\n",
      "load on _his_ leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the\n",
      "bread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped\n",

      "that I could make out nothing of it but the single word “Pip.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost\n",
      "pains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a\n",
      "word that looked to me like “sulks.” Therefore, I naturally pointed to\n",
      "Mrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, “her?” But Joe\n",
      "wouldn’t hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide,\n",

      "\n",
      "“That’s the way with this boy!” exclaimed my sister, pointing me out\n",
      "with her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. “Answer him one\n",
      "question, and he’ll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,\n",

      "It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the\n",
      "outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there\n",
      "all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw\n",
      "the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort\n",
      "of spiders’ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.\n",
      "On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so\n",
      "thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our\n",
      "village—a direction which they never accepted, for they never came\n",
      "there—was invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I\n",

      "banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly\n",
      "as could be, “A boy with somebody else’s pork pie! Stop him!” The\n",
      "cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,\n",
      "and steaming out of their nostrils, “Halloa, young thief!” One black\n",
      "ox, with a white cravat on,—who even had to my awakened conscience\n",
      "something of a clerical air,—fixed me so obstinately with his eyes, and\n",
      "moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved\n",
      "round, that I blubbered out to him, “I couldn’t help it, sir! It wasn’t\n",

      "All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I\n",
      "went, I couldn’t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted,\n",
      "as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I\n",
      "knew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there\n",

      "cold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face\n",
      "and die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that\n",
      "when I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it\n",
      "occurred to me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my\n",

      "hurry, than a man who was eating it,—but he left off to take some of\n",
      "the liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite\n",

      "swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;\n",
      "and he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought\n",
      "there was danger in every direction of somebody’s coming to take the\n",

      "house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon\n",
      "the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,—an article into\n",

      "vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.\n",

      "“And where the deuce ha’ _you_ been?” was Mrs. Joe’s Christmas\n",

      "\n",
      "I said I had been down to hear the Carols. “Ah! well!” observed Mrs.\n",

      "“Perhaps if I warn’t a blacksmith’s wife, and (what’s the same thing) a\n",
      "slave with her apron never off, _I_ should have been to hear the\n",
      "Carols,” said Mrs. Joe. “I’m rather partial to Carols, myself, and\n",
      "that’s the best of reasons for my never hearing any.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had\n",
      "retired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a\n",
      "conciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her\n",
      "eyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and\n",
      "exhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.\n",
      "This was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for\n",
      "weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to\n",
      "their legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork\n",
      "and greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had\n",
      "been made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not\n",
      "being missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive\n",
      "arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of\n",
      "breakfast; “for I ain’t,” said Mrs. Joe,—“I ain’t a-going to have no\n",
      "formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I’ve got\n",
      "before me, I promise you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on\n",
      "a forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of\n",
      "milk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the\n",
      "dresser. In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and\n",
      "tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the\n",
      "old one, and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage,\n",
      "which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the\n",
      "year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four\n",
      "little white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black\n",
      "nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of\n",
      "the other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite\n",
      "art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than\n",
      "dirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the\n",
      "same by their religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that\n",
      "is to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a\n",
      "well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he\n",
      "was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.\n",
      "Nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and\n",
      "everything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive\n",
      "occasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,\n",
      "the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me,\n",
      "I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young\n",
      "offender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and\n",
      "delivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged\n",
      "majesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being\n",
      "born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,\n",
      "and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I\n",
      "was taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make\n",
      "them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the\n",
      "free use of my limbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle\n",
      "for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to\n",
      "what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.\n",
      "Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be\n",
      "equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had\n",
      "done. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the\n",
      "Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the\n",
      "terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived\n",
      "the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman\n",
      "said, “Ye are now to declare it!” would be the time for me to rise and\n",
      "propose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure\n",
      "that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to\n",
      "this extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble\n",
      "the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle,\n",
      "but Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in\n",
      "the nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was\n",
      "half-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and\n",
      "Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked\n",
      "(it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and\n",
      "everything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and\n",
      "the company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large\n",
      "shining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud\n",
      "of; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could\n",
      "only give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he\n",
      "himself confessed that if the Church was “thrown open,” meaning to\n",
      "competition, he would not despair of making his mark in it. The Church\n",
      "not being “thrown open,” he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he\n",
      "punished the Amens tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,—always\n",
      "giving the whole verse,—he looked all round the congregation first, as\n",
      "much as to say, “You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your\n",
      "opinion of this style!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I opened the door to the company,—making believe that it was a habit of\n",
      "ours to open that door,—and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next to\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. _I_ was\n",
      "not allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Joe,” said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged\n",
      "slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair\n",
      "standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been\n",
      "all but choked, and had that moment come to, “I have brought you as the\n",
      "compliments of the season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry\n",
      "wine—and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Every Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with\n",
      "exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.\n",
      "Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, “O, Un—cle\n",
      "Pum-ble—chook! This _is_ kind!” Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as he\n",
      "now retorted, “It’s no more than your merits. And now are you all\n",
      "bobbish, and how’s Sixpennorth of halfpence?” meaning me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts\n",
      "and oranges and apples to the parlour; which was a change very like\n",
      "Joe’s change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister\n",
      "was uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally\n",
      "more gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I\n",
      "remember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue,\n",
      "who held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married\n",
      "Mr. Hubble,—I don’t know at what remote period,—when she was much\n",
      "younger than he. I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,\n",
      "stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs\n",
      "extraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some\n",
      "miles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn’t\n",
      "robbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in\n",
      "at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and\n",
      "the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to\n",
      "speak (I didn’t want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the\n",
      "scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure\n",
      "corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason\n",
      "to be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have\n",
      "left me alone. But they wouldn’t leave me alone. They seemed to think\n",
      "the opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,\n",
      "every now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an\n",
      "unfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched\n",
      "up by these moral goads.\n",
      "\n",
      "It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with\n",
      "theatrical declamation,—as it now appears to me, something like a\n",
      "religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,—and\n",
      "ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.\n",
      "Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low\n",
      "reproachful voice, “Do you hear that? Be grateful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Especially,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “be grateful, boy, to them which\n",
      "brought you up by hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful\n",
      "presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, “Why is it that the\n",
      "young are never grateful?” This moral mystery seemed too much for the\n",
      "company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, “Naterally\n",
      "wicious.” Everybody then murmured “True!” and looked at me in a\n",
      "particularly unpleasant and personal manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe’s station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when\n",
      "there was company than when there was none. But he always aided and\n",
      "comforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did\n",
      "so at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being\n",
      "plenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about\n",
      "half a pint.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with\n",
      "some severity, and intimated—in the usual hypothetical case of the\n",
      "Church being “thrown open”—what kind of sermon _he_ would have given\n",
      "them. After favouring them with some heads of that discourse, he\n",
      "remarked that he considered the subject of the day’s homily, ill\n",
      "chosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when there were so many\n",
      "subjects “going about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“True again,” said Uncle Pumblechook. “You’ve hit it, sir! Plenty of\n",
      "subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their\n",
      "tails. That’s what’s wanted. A man needn’t go far to find a subject, if\n",
      "he’s ready with his salt-box.” Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short\n",
      "interval of reflection, “Look at Pork alone. There’s a subject! If you\n",
      "want a subject, look at Pork!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“True, sir. Many a moral for the young,” returned Mr. Wopsle,—and I\n",
      "knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; “might be deduced\n",
      "from that text.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(“You listen to this,” said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe gave me some more gravy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Swine,” pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his\n",
      "fork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,—“swine\n",
      "were the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put\n",
      "before us, as an example to the young.” (I thought this pretty well in\n",
      "him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.)\n",
      "“What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or girl,” suggested Mr. Hubble.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,” assented Mr. Wopsle, rather\n",
      "irritably, “but there is no girl present.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Besides,” said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, “think what\n",
      "you’ve got to be grateful for. If you’d been born a Squeaker—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He _was_, if ever a child was,” said my sister, most emphatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe gave me some more gravy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “If\n",
      "you had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unless in that form,” said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don’t mean in that form, sir,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had\n",
      "an objection to being interrupted; “I mean, enjoying himself with his\n",
      "elders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and\n",
      "rolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he\n",
      "wouldn’t. And what would have been your destination?” turning on me\n",
      "again. “You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according\n",
      "to the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would\n",
      "have come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped\n",
      "you under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his\n",
      "frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would\n",
      "have shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then.\n",
      "Not a bit of it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was a world of trouble to you, ma’am,” said Mrs. Hubble,\n",
      "commiserating my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trouble?” echoed my sister; “trouble?” and then entered on a fearful\n",
      "catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts\n",
      "of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled\n",
      "from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I\n",
      "had done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I\n",
      "had contumaciously refused to go there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with\n",
      "their noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in\n",
      "consequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle’s Roman nose so aggravated me, during\n",
      "the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it\n",
      "until he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in\n",
      "comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the\n",
      "pause was broken which ensued upon my sister’s recital, and in which\n",
      "pause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with\n",
      "indignation and abhorrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yet,” said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the\n",
      "theme from which they had strayed, “Pork—regarded as biled—is rich,\n",
      "too; ain’t it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have a little brandy, uncle,” said my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "O Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say\n",
      "it was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under\n",
      "the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,\n",
      "and poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man\n",
      "trifled with his glass,—took it up, looked at it through the light, put\n",
      "it down,—prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were\n",
      "briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn’t keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the\n",
      "table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his\n",
      "glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink the\n",
      "brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with\n",
      "unspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning\n",
      "round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and\n",
      "rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,\n",
      "violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces,\n",
      "and apparently out of his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn’t know how I\n",
      "had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my\n",
      "dreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and\n",
      "surveying the company all round as if _they_ had disagreed with him,\n",
      "sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp, “Tar!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be\n",
      "worse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day,\n",
      "by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tar!” cried my sister, in amazement. “Why, how ever could Tar come\n",
      "there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn’t\n",
      "hear the word, wouldn’t hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all\n",
      "away with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had\n",
      "begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in\n",
      "getting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and\n",
      "mixing them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on\n",
      "to the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of\n",
      "gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of\n",
      "pudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.\n",
      "The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the\n",
      "genial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over\n",
      "the day, when my sister said to Joe, “Clean plates,—cold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my\n",
      "bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my\n",
      "soul. I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was\n",
      "gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must taste,” said my sister, addressing the guests with her best\n",
      "grace—“you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious\n",
      "present of Uncle Pumblechook’s!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Must they! Let them not hope to taste it!\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must know,” said my sister, rising, “it’s a pie; a savory pork\n",
      "pie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of\n",
      "having deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,—quite vivaciously,\n",
      "all things considered,—“Well, Mrs. Joe, we’ll do our best endeavours;\n",
      "let us have a cut at this same pie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry.\n",
      "I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in\n",
      "the Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that “a bit\n",
      "of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do\n",
      "no harm,” and I heard Joe say, “You shall have some, Pip.” I have never\n",
      "been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,\n",
      "merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that\n",
      "I could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of\n",
      "the table, and ran for my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost\n",
      "into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a\n",
      "pair of handcuffs to me, saying, “Here you are, look sharp, come on!”\n",

      "\n",

      "Chapter V.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their\n",
      "loaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise from\n",
      "table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen\n",
      "empty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of\n",
      "“Gracious goodness gracious me, what’s gone—with the—pie!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring; at\n",
      "which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was the\n",
      "sergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at the\n",
      "company, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his\n",
      "right hand, and his left on my shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me, ladies and gentleman,” said the sergeant, “but as I have\n",
      "mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver,” (which he hadn’t),\n",
      "“I am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And pray what might you want with _him_?” retorted my sister, quick to\n",
      "resent his being wanted at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Missis,” returned the gallant sergeant, “speaking for myself, I should\n",
      "reply, the honour and pleasure of his fine wife’s acquaintance;\n",
      "speaking for the king, I answer, a little job done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.\n",
      "Pumblechook cried audibly, “Good again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, blacksmith,” said the sergeant, who had by this time picked\n",
      "out Joe with his eye, “we have had an accident with these, and I find\n",
      "the lock of one of ’em goes wrong, and the coupling don’t act pretty.\n",
      "As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over\n",
      "them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would\n",
      "necessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer two\n",
      "hours than one. “Will it? Then will you set about it at once,\n",
      "blacksmith?” said the off-hand sergeant, “as it’s on his Majesty’s\n",
      "service. And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they’ll make\n",
      "themselves useful.” With that, he called to his men, who came trooping\n",
      "into the kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner.\n",
      "And then they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands\n",
      "loosely clasped before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now,\n",
      "easing a belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over\n",
      "their high stocks, out into the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I was\n",
      "in an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the\n",
      "handcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the\n",
      "better of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little\n",
      "more of my scattered wits.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you give me the time?” said the sergeant, addressing himself to\n",
      "Mr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the\n",
      "inference that he was equal to the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s just gone half past two.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s not so bad,” said the sergeant, reflecting; “even if I was\n",
      "forced to halt here nigh two hours, that’ll do. How far might you call\n",
      "yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just a mile,” said Mrs. Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’ll do. We begin to close in upon ’em about dusk. A little before\n",
      "dusk, my orders are. That’ll do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Convicts, sergeant?” asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay!” returned the sergeant, “two. They’re pretty well known to be out\n",
      "on the marshes still, and they won’t try to get clear of ’em before\n",
      "dusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of\n",
      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said the sergeant, “they’ll find themselves trapped in a\n",
      "circle, I expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you’re\n",
      "ready, his Majesty the King is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather\n",
      "apron on, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its\n",
      "wooden windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the\n",
      "bellows, the rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then\n",
      "Joe began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general\n",
      "attention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of beer\n",
      "from the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a\n",
      "glass of brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, “Give him wine,\n",
      "Mum. I’ll engage there’s no tar in that:” so, the sergeant thanked him\n",
      "and said that as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take\n",
      "wine, if it was equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank his\n",
      "Majesty’s health and compliments of the season, and took it all at a\n",
      "mouthful and smacked his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good stuff, eh, sergeant?” said Mr. Pumblechook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you something,” returned the sergeant; “I suspect that\n",
      "stuff’s of _your_ providing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, “Ay, ay? Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because,” returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, “you’re\n",
      "a man that knows what’s what.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“D’ye think so?” said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. “Have\n",
      "another glass!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With you. Hob and nob,” returned the sergeant. “The top of mine to the\n",
      "foot of yours,—the foot of yours to the top of mine,—Ring once, ring\n",
      "twice,—the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you live\n",
      "a thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you\n",
      "are at the present moment of your life!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for\n",
      "another glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality\n",
      "appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the\n",
      "bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a\n",
      "gush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine\n",
      "that he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with\n",
      "the same liberality, when the first was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,\n",
      "enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for a\n",
      "dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed\n",
      "themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened\n",
      "with the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively\n",
      "anticipation of “the two villains” being taken, and when the bellows\n",
      "seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke\n",
      "to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and\n",
      "all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the\n",
      "blaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale\n",
      "afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have\n",
      "turned pale on their account, poor wretches.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, Joe’s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As\n",
      "Joe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us\n",
      "should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr.\n",
      "Pumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies’\n",
      "society; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was\n",
      "agreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should\n",
      "have got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe’s curiosity to know\n",
      "all about it and how it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, “If\n",
      "you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket, don’t\n",
      "look to me to put it together again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.\n",
      "Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully\n",
      "sensible of that gentleman’s merits under arid conditions, as when\n",
      "something moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.\n",
      "Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and\n",
      "to speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in\n",
      "the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I\n",
      "treasonably whispered to Joe, “I hope, Joe, we shan’t find them.” and\n",
      "Joe whispered to me, “I’d give a shilling if they had cut and run,\n",
      "Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was\n",
      "cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming\n",
      "on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A\n",
      "few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came\n",
      "out. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.\n",
      "There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant’s\n",
      "hand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the\n",
      "graves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding\n",
      "anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate\n",
      "at the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us\n",
      "here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little\n",
      "thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men\n",
      "hiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should\n",
      "come upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who\n",
      "had brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving\n",
      "imp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the\n",
      "hunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in\n",
      "treacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe’s\n",
      "back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a\n",
      "hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and\n",
      "to keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a\n",
      "pretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking\n",
      "the course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.\n",
      "Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.\n",
      "Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the\n",
      "mound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,\n",
      "though all of a watery lead colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe’s broad shoulder, I\n",
      "looked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I\n",
      "could hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by\n",
      "his blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and\n",
      "could dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful\n",
      "start, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a\n",
      "sheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;\n",
      "and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared\n",
      "angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except\n",
      "these things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,\n",
      "there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.\n",

      "The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we\n",

      "stopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a\n",
      "long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but\n",
      "it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised\n",
      "together,—if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under\n",
      "their breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment’s listening,\n",
      "Joe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)\n",
      "agreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not\n",
      "be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men\n",
      "should make towards it “at the double.” So we slanted to the right\n",
      "(where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had\n",
      "to hold on tight to keep my seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he\n",
      "spoke all the time, “a Winder.” Down banks and up banks, and over\n",
      "gates, and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no\n",
      "man cared where he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became\n",
      "more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.\n",
      "Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.\n",
      "When it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate\n",
      "than ever, and we after them. After a while, we had so run it down,\n",
      "that we could hear one voice calling “Murder!” and another voice,\n",
      "“Convicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the runaway convicts!” Then\n",
      "both voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then would\n",
      "break out again. And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran like\n",
      "deer, and Joe too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and\n",
      "two of his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and\n",
      "levelled when we all ran in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here are both men!” panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a\n",
      "ditch. “Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come\n",
      "asunder!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn,\n",
      "and blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the\n",
      "ditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and\n",
      "the other one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and\n",
      "struggling; but of course I knew them both directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mind!” said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged\n",
      "sleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: “_I_ took him! _I_\n",
      "give him up to you! Mind that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not much to be particular about,” said the sergeant; “it’ll do\n",

      "there!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t expect it to do me any good. I don’t want it to do me more\n",
      "good than it does now,” said my convict, with a greedy laugh. “I took\n",
      "him. He knows it. That’s enough for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old\n",
      "bruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.\n",
      "He could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both\n",
      "separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from\n",
      "falling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take notice, guard,—he tried to murder me,” were his first words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tried to murder him?” said my convict, disdainfully. “Try, and not do\n",
      "it? I took him, and giv’ him up; that’s what I done. I not only\n",
      "prevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,—dragged\n",
      "him this far on his way back. He’s a gentleman, if you please, this\n",
      "villain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder\n",
      "him? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag\n",
      "him back!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The other one still gasped, “He tried—he tried-to—murder me. Bear—bear\n",
      "witness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lookee here!” said my convict to the sergeant. “Single-handed I got\n",
      "clear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha’ got\n",
      "clear of these death-cold flats likewise—look at my leg: you won’t find\n",
      "much iron on it—if I hadn’t made the discovery that _he_ was here. Let\n",
      "_him_ go free? Let _him_ profit by the means as I found out? Let _him_\n",
      "make a tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had\n",
      "died at the bottom there,” and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch\n",
      "with his manacled hands, “I’d have held to him with that grip, that you\n",
      "should have been safe to find him in my hold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his\n",
      "companion, repeated, “He tried to murder me. I should have been a dead\n",
      "man if you had not come up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He lies!” said my convict, with fierce energy. “He’s a liar born, and\n",
      "he’ll die a liar. Look at his face; ain’t it written there? Let him\n",
      "turn those eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not,\n",
      "however, collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set\n",
      "expression, looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and\n",
      "at the sky, but certainly did not look at the speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you see him?” pursued my convict. “Do you see what a villain he is?\n",
      "Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That’s how he looked\n",
      "when we were tried together. He never looked at me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes\n",
      "restlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment\n",
      "on the speaker, with the words, “You are not much to look at,” and with\n",
      "a half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict\n",
      "became so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him\n",
      "but for the interposition of the soldiers. “Didn’t I tell you,” said\n",
      "the other convict then, “that he would murder me, if he could?” And any\n",
      "one could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon\n",
      "his lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Enough of this parley,” said the sergeant. “Light those torches.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went\n",
      "down on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first\n",
      "time, and saw me. I had alighted from Joe’s back on the brink of the\n",
      "ditch when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly\n",
      "when he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I\n",
      "had been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my\n",
      "innocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended\n",
      "my intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it\n",
      "all passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a\n",
      "day, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having\n",
      "been more attentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four\n",
      "torches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been\n",
      "almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards\n",
      "very dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in\n",
      "a ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches\n",
      "kindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the\n",
      "opposite bank of the river. “All right,” said the sergeant. “March.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a\n",
      "sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. “You are expected\n",
      "on board,” said the sergeant to my convict; “they know you are coming.\n",
      "Don’t straggle, my man. Close up here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate\n",
      "guard. I had hold of Joe’s hand now, and Joe carried one of the\n",
      "torches. Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to\n",
      "see it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good\n",
      "path now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and\n",
      "there where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy\n",
      "sluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming\n",
      "in after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon\n",
      "the track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I\n",
      "could see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air\n",
      "about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather\n",
      "to like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. We\n",
      "could not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,\n",
      "that two or three times we had to halt while they rested.\n",
      "\n",
      "After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut\n",
      "and a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,\n",
      "and the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was\n",
      "a smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a\n",
      "stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an\n",
      "overgrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a\n",
      "dozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in\n",
      "their great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their\n",
      "heads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant\n",
      "made some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the\n",
      "convict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard,\n",
      "to go on board first.\n",
      "\n",
      "My convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the\n",
      "hut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up\n",
      "his feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if\n",
      "he pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the\n",
      "sergeant, and remarked,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some\n",
      "persons laying under suspicion alonger me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can say what you like,” returned the sergeant, standing coolly\n",
      "looking at him with his arms folded, “but you have no call to say it\n",
      "here. You’ll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about\n",
      "it, before it’s done with, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can’t\n",
      "starve; at least _I_ can’t. I took some wittles, up at the willage over\n",
      "yonder,—where the church stands a’most out on the marshes.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“It was some broken wittles—that’s what it was—and a dram of liquor,\n",
      "and a pie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?” asked\n",
      "the sergeant, confidentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don’t you know,\n",
      "Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So,” said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and\n",
      "without the least glance at me,—“so you’re the blacksmith, are you?\n",
      "Than I’m sorry to say, I’ve eat your pie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God knows you’re welcome to it,—so far as it was ever mine,” returned\n",
      "Joe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. “We don’t know what you\n",

      "The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man’s throat\n",

      "were ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough\n",
      "stakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a\n",
      "crew of convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or\n",
      "interested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or\n",
      "spoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs,\n",
      "“Give way, you!” which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the\n",
      "light of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from\n",
      "the mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah’s ark. Cribbed and barred and\n",
      "moored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes\n",
      "to be ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we\n",
      "saw him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches\n",
      "were flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over\n",

      "you up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,\n",
      "along with all the folks. As to you,” Joe pursued with a countenance\n",
      "expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, “if you could have\n",
      "been aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you’d have\n",
      "formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!”\n",

      "“But I did mind you, Pip,” he returned with tender simplicity. “When I\n",
      "offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at\n",
      "such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to\n",
      "her, ‘And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little\n",
      "child,’ I said to your sister, ‘there’s room for _him_ at the forge!’”\n",

      "an’t us, Pip? Don’t cry, old chap!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That’s about where it lights;\n",
      "here we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I\n",
      "tell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn’t\n",
      "see too much of what we’re up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the\n",
      "sly. And why on the sly? I’ll tell you why, Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could\n",
      "have proceeded in his demonstration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your sister is given to government.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Given to government, Joe?” I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea\n",
      "(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a\n",
      "favour of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Given to government,” said Joe. “Which I meantersay the government of\n",
      "you and myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And she an’t over partial to having scholars on the premises,” Joe\n",
      "continued, “and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a\n",
      "scholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don’t you\n",
      "see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as “Why—”\n",
      "when Joe stopped me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stay a bit. I know what you’re a-going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I\n",
      "don’t deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I\n",
      "don’t deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down\n",
      "upon us heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page,\n",
      "Pip,” Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, “candour\n",
      "compels fur to admit that she is a Buster.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital\n",
      "Bs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off,\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, Joe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might\n",
      "feel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that\n",
      "placid occupation; “your sister’s a master-mind. A master-mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s that?” I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But\n",
      "Joe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely\n",
      "stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,\n",
      "“Her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I ain’t a master-mind,” Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,\n",
      "and got back to his whisker. “And last of all, Pip,—and this I want to\n",
      "say very serious to you, old chap,—I see so much in my poor mother, of\n",
      "a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never\n",
      "getting no peace in her mortal days, that I’m dead afeerd of going\n",
      "wrong in the way of not doing what’s right by a woman, and I’d fur\n",
      "rather of the two go wrong the t’other way, and be a little\n",
      "ill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I\n",
      "wish there warn’t no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it\n",
      "all on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and\n",
      "I hope you’ll overlook shortcomings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from\n",
      "that night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but,\n",
      "afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about\n",
      "him, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up\n",
      "to Joe in my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“However,” said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; “here’s the\n",
      "Dutch-clock a-working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of ’em,\n",
      "and she’s not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook’s mare mayn’t\n",
      "have set a forefoot on a piece o’ ice, and gone down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,\n",
      "to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a\n",
      "woman’s judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no\n",
      "confidences in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe\n",
      "was out on one of these expeditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to\n",
      "listen for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew\n",
      "keenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of\n",
      "lying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars,\n",
      "and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to\n",
      "them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the\n",
      "glittering multitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here comes the mare,” said Joe, “ringing like a peal of bells!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as\n",
      "she came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out,\n",
      "ready for Mrs. Joe’s alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might\n",
      "see a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that\n",
      "nothing might be out of its place. When we had completed these\n",
      "preparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon\n",
      "landed, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with\n",
      "a cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air\n",
      "in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and\n",
      "throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,\n",
      "“if this boy ain’t grateful this night, he never will be!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly\n",
      "uninformed why he ought to assume that expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s only to be hoped,” said my sister, “that he won’t be Pompeyed.\n",
      "But I have my fears.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She ain’t in that line, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “She knows\n",
      "better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,\n",
      "“She?” Joe looked at me, making the motion with _his_ lips and\n",
      "eyebrows, “She?” My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of\n",
      "his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such\n",
      "occasions, and looked at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?” said my sister, in her snappish way. “What are you staring at?\n",
      "Is the house afire?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“—Which some individual,” Joe politely hinted, “mentioned—she.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And she is a she, I suppose?” said my sister. “Unless you call Miss\n",
      "Havisham a he. And I doubt if even you’ll go so far as that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Havisham, up town?” said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there any Miss Havisham down town?” returned my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he’s going. And\n",
      "he had better play there,” said my sister, shaking her head at me as an\n",
      "encouragement to be extremely light and sportive, “or I’ll work him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had heard of Miss Havisham up town,—everybody for miles round had\n",
      "heard of Miss Havisham up town,—as an immensely rich and grim lady who\n",

      "led a life of seclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well to be sure!” said Joe, astounded. “I wonder how she come to know\n",

      "Mr. Pumblechook’s premises in the High Street of the market town, were\n",
      "of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a\n",
      "cornchandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he must be\n",
      "a very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop;\n",
      "and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and\n",
      "saw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds\n",
      "and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and\n",
      "bloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this\n",
      "speculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in\n",
      "an attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the\n",
      "bedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my\n",
      "eyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity\n",
      "between seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did\n",
      "his shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavour about the\n",
      "corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and\n",
      "flavour about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I\n",
      "hardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me for\n",
      "noticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by\n",
      "looking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact\n",
      "_his_ business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to\n",
      "get on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating\n",
      "the baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer,\n",
      "who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist. The watchmaker, always\n",
      "poring over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, and\n",
      "always inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the\n",
      "glass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the\n",
      "High Street whose trade engaged his attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o’clock in the parlour\n",
      "behind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of\n",
      "bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered\n",
      "Mr. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my\n",
      "sister’s idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be\n",
      "imparted to my diet,—besides giving me as much crumb as possible in\n",
      "combination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm\n",
      "water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the\n",
      "milk out altogether,—his conversation consisted of nothing but\n",
      "arithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,\n",
      "pompously, “Seven times nine, boy?” And how should _I_ be able to\n",
      "answer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I\n",
      "was hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum\n",
      "that lasted all through the breakfast. “Seven?” “And four?” “And\n",
      "eight?” “And six?” “And two?” “And ten?” And so on. And after each\n",
      "figure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a\n",
      "sup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,\n",
      "and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)\n",
      "a gorging and gormandizing manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "For such reasons, I was very glad when ten o’clock came and we started\n",
      "for Miss Havisham’s; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the\n",
      "manner in which I should acquit myself under that lady’s roof. Within a\n",
      "quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham’s house, which was of old\n",
      "brick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the\n",
      "windows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were\n",
      "rustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so\n",
      "we had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come to\n",
      "open it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.\n",
      "Pumblechook said, “And fourteen?” but I pretended not to hear him), and\n",
      "saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing\n",
      "was going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded “What name?” To which\n",
      "my conductor replied, “Pumblechook.” The voice returned, “Quite right,”\n",
      "and the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the\n",
      "court-yard, with keys in her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “is Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is Pip, is it?” returned the young lady, who was very pretty and\n",
      "seemed very proud; “come in, Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” she said. “Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Miss Havisham wished to see me,” returned Mr. Pumblechook,\n",
      "discomfited.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” said the girl; “but you see she don’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.\n",
      "Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not\n",
      "protest. But he eyed me severely,—as if _I_ had done anything to\n",
      "him!—and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: “Boy! Let\n",
      "your behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up by\n",
      "hand!” I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to\n",
      "propound through the gate, “And sixteen?” But he didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.\n",
      "It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The\n",
      "brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the\n",
      "wooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood\n",
      "open, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.\n",
      "The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and it\n",
      "made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the\n",
      "brewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw me looking at it, and she said, “You could drink without hurt\n",
      "all the strong beer that’s brewed there now, boy.”\n",

      "“I should think I could, miss,” said I, in a shy way.\n",

      "Hebrew, or all three—or all one to me—for enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Enough House,” said I; “that’s a curious name, miss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” she replied; “but it meant more than it said. It meant, when it\n",
      "was given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They\n",
      "must have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But\n",
      "don’t loiter, boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Though she called me “boy” so often, and with a carelessness that was\n",
      "far from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much\n",
      "older than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and\n",
      "self-possessed; and she was as scornful of me as if she had been\n",
      "one-and-twenty, and a queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two\n",
      "chains across it outside,—and the first thing I noticed was, that the\n",
      "passages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.\n",
      "She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,\n",
      "and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last we came to the door of a room, and she said, “Go in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I answered, more in shyness than politeness, “After you, miss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To this she returned: “Don’t be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.”\n",
      "And scornfully walked away, and—what was worse—took the candle with\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only\n",
      "thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told\n",
      "from within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a\n",
      "pretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of\n",
      "daylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed\n",
      "from the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite\n",
      "unknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded\n",
      "looking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady’s\n",
      "dressing-table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no\n",
      "fine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbow\n",
      "resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the\n",
      "strangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was dressed in rich materials,—satins, and lace, and silks,—all of\n",
      "white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent\n",
      "from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was\n",
      "white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and\n",
      "some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid\n",
      "than the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.\n",
      "She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,—the\n",
      "other was on the table near her hand,—her veil was but half arranged,\n",
      "her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay\n",
      "with those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some\n",
      "flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the\n",
      "looking-glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though\n",
      "I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I\n",
      "saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been\n",
      "white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw\n",
      "that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and\n",
      "like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her\n",
      "sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure\n",
      "of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had\n",
      "shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly\n",
      "waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage\n",
      "lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches\n",
      "to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of\n",
      "a vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to\n",
      "have dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if\n",
      "I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is it?” said the lady at the table.\n",

      "\n",
      "It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of\n",
      "the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped\n",
      "at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at\n",
      "twenty minutes to nine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at me,” said Miss Havisham. “You are not afraid of a woman who\n",

      "\n",
      "I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie\n",
      "comprehended in the answer “No.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and\n",
      "with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept\n",
      "her hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if\n",
      "they were heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am tired,” said Miss Havisham. “I want diversion, and I have done\n",
      "with men and women. Play.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she\n",
      "could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the\n",
      "wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sometimes have sick fancies,” she went on, “and I have a sick fancy\n",
      "that I want to see some play. There, there!” with an impatient movement\n",
      "of the fingers of her right hand; “play, play, play!”\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment, with the fear of my sister’s working me before my eyes, I\n",
      "had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed\n",
      "character of Mr. Pumblechook’s chaise-cart. But I felt myself so\n",
      "unequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss\n",
      "Havisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as\n",
      "she said, when we had taken a good look at each other,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you sullen and obstinate?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, ma’am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can’t play just\n",
      "now. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so\n",
      "I would do it if I could; but it’s so new here, and so strange, and so\n",
      "fine,—and melancholy—.” I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had\n",
      "already said it, and we took another look at each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the\n",
      "dress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in\n",
      "the looking-glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So new to him,” she muttered, “so old to me; so strange to him, so\n",
      "familiar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she\n",
      "was still talking to herself, and kept quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call Estella,” she repeated, flashing a look at me. “You can do that.\n",
      "Call Estella. At the door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,\n",
      "bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor\n",
      "responsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name,\n",
      "was almost as bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and\n",
      "her light came along the dark passage like a star.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the\n",
      "table, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her\n",
      "pretty brown hair. “Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it\n",
      "well. Let me see you play cards with this boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With this boy? Why, he is a common labouring-boy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,—only it seemed so\n",
      "unlikely,—“Well? You can break his heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you play, boy?” asked Estella of myself, with the greatest\n",
      "disdain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beggar him,” said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had\n",
      "stopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that\n",
      "Miss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had\n",
      "taken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the\n",
      "dressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now\n",
      "yellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the\n",
      "shoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now\n",
      "yellow, had been trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything,\n",
      "this standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the\n",
      "withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like\n",
      "grave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and\n",
      "trimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew\n",
      "nothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies\n",
      "buried in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being\n",
      "distinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have\n",
      "looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have\n",
      "struck her to dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!” said Estella with disdain,\n",
      "before our first game was out. “And what coarse hands he has! And what\n",
      "thick boots!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to\n",
      "consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so\n",
      "strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I\n",
      "knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for\n",
      "a stupid, clumsy labouring-boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You say nothing of her,” remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked\n",
      "on. “She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What\n",
      "do you think of her?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I think I should like to go home.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“I am not sure that I shouldn’t like to see her again, but I should\n",
      "like to go home now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall go soon,” said Miss Havisham, aloud. “Play the game out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure\n",
      "that Miss Havisham’s face could not smile. It had dropped into a\n",
      "watchful and brooding expression,—most likely when all the things about\n",
      "her had become transfixed,—and it looked as if nothing could ever lift\n",
      "it up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice\n",
      "had dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;\n",
      "altogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,\n",
      "within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She\n",
      "threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she\n",
      "despised them for having been won of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When shall I have you here again?” said Miss Havisham. “Let me think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when she\n",
      "checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her\n",
      "right hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of\n",
      "weeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Estella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him\n",
      "roam and look about him while he eats. Go, Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she\n",
      "stood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the side\n",
      "entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must\n",
      "necessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded\n",
      "me, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange\n",
      "room many hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are to wait here, you boy,” said Estella; and disappeared and\n",
      "closed the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my\n",
      "coarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was\n",
      "not favourable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled me\n",
      "now, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever\n",
      "taught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called\n",
      "knaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and\n",
      "then I should have been so too.\n",
      "\n",
      "She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She\n",
      "put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and\n",
      "meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in\n",
      "disgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,—I\n",
      "cannot hit upon the right name for the smart—God knows what its name\n",
      "was,—that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the\n",
      "girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of\n",
      "them. This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she\n",
      "gave a contemptuous toss—but with a sense, I thought, of having made\n",
      "too sure that I was so wounded—and left me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face\n",
      "in, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my\n",
      "sleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.\n",
      "As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so\n",
      "bitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name,\n",
      "that needed counteraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister’s bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in\n",
      "which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is\n",
      "nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be\n",
      "only small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child is\n",
      "small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many\n",
      "hands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within\n",
      "myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with\n",
      "injustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my\n",
      "sister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had\n",
      "cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave\n",
      "her no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments,\n",
      "disgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had\n",
      "nursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a\n",
      "solitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was\n",
      "morally timid and very sensitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the\n",
      "brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my\n",
      "face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat\n",
      "were acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon\n",
      "in spirits to look about me.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the\n",
      "brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high\n",
      "wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there\n",
      "had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no\n",
      "pigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,\n",
      "no malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper\n",
      "or the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have\n",
      "evaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a\n",
      "wilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of\n",
      "better days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as\n",
      "a sample of the beer that was gone,—and in this respect I remember\n",
      "those recluses as being like most others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old\n",
      "wall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough\n",
      "to look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the\n",
      "house, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was\n",
      "a track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes\n",
      "walked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But\n",
      "she seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation\n",
      "presented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walking\n",
      "on them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me,\n",
      "and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never\n",
      "looked round, and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery\n",
      "itself,—by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used\n",
      "to make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were. When I\n",
      "first went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the\n",
      "door looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and\n",
      "ascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,\n",
      "as if she were going out into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened\n",
      "to my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a\n",
      "stranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes—a little dimmed by\n",
      "looking up at the frosty light—towards a great wooden beam in a low\n",
      "nook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure\n",
      "hanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but one\n",
      "shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded\n",
      "trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was\n",
      "Miss Havisham’s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if\n",
      "she were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure, and\n",
      "in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment\n",
      "before, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror\n",
      "was greatest of all when I found no figure there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of\n",
      "people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving\n",
      "influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have\n",
      "brought me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself\n",
      "as soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to\n",
      "let me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I\n",
      "thought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that\n",
      "my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the\n",
      "gate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,\n",
      "when she touched me with a taunting hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t you cry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I don’t want to.”\n",

      "“You do,” said she. “You have been crying till you are half blind, and\n",
      "you are near crying again now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.\n",
      "I went straight to Mr. Pumblechook’s, and was immensely relieved to\n",
      "find him not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I\n",
      "was wanted at Miss Havisham’s again, I set off on the four-mile walk to\n",
      "our forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply\n",
      "revolving that I was a common labouring-boy; that my hands were coarse;\n",
      "that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of\n",
      "calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had\n",
      "considered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived\n",
      "bad way.\n",

      "When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss\n",
      "Havisham’s, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself\n",
      "getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the\n",
      "small of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the\n",
      "kitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient\n",
      "length.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other\n",
      "young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden\n",
      "in mine,—which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason to\n",
      "suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,—it is the key to many\n",
      "reservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham’s as\n",
      "my eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I\n",
      "felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and\n",
      "although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an\n",
      "impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my\n",
      "dragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before\n",
      "the contemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I\n",
      "could, and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by\n",
      "a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came\n",
      "gaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details\n",
      "divulged to him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes\n",
      "and mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat\n",
      "heaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, boy,” Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the\n",
      "chair of honour by the fire. “How did you get on up town?”\n",

      "I answered, “Pretty well, sir,” and my sister shook her fist at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pretty well?” Mr. Pumblechook repeated. “Pretty well is no answer.\n",
      "Tell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?”\n",

      "Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy\n",
      "perhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my\n",
      "obstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered\n",
      "as if I had discovered a new idea, “I mean pretty well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,—I\n",

      "Pumblechook interposed with “No! Don’t lose your temper. Leave this lad\n",
      "to me, ma’am; leave this lad to me.” Mr. Pumblechook then turned me\n",
      "towards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I calculated the consequences of replying “Four Hundred Pound,” and\n",
      "finding them against me, went as near the answer as I could—which was\n",
      "somewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my\n",
      "pence-table from “twelve pence make one shilling,” up to “forty pence\n",
      "make three and fourpence,” and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had\n",
      "done for me, “_Now!_ How much is forty-three pence?” To which I\n",
      "replied, after a long interval of reflection, “I don’t know.” And I was\n",
      "so aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, and\n",
      "said, “Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for\n",
      "instance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!” said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was\n",
      "highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and\n",
      "brought him to a dead stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?” Mr. Pumblechook began again when he\n",
      "had recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the\n",
      "screw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very tall and dark,” I told him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she, uncle?” asked my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he\n",
      "had never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. (“This is the way to have\n",
      "him! We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?”)\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure, uncle,” returned Mrs. Joe, “I wish you had him always; you\n",

      "might—and both repeated, “In a black velvet coach?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said I. “And Miss Estella—that’s her niece, I think—handed her\n",
      "in cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had\n",
      "cake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat\n",
      "mine, because she told me to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was anybody else there?” asked Mr. Pumblechook.\n",

      "\n",

      "basket.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter\n",
      "amazement. I was perfectly frantic,—a reckless witness under the\n",
      "torture,—and would have told them anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where _was_ this coach, in the name of gracious?” asked my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In Miss Havisham’s room.” They stared again. “But there weren’t any\n",
      "horses to it.” I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting\n",
      "four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of\n",
      "harnessing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can this be possible, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe. “What can the boy mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “My opinion is, it’s a\n",
      "sedan-chair. She’s flighty, you know,—very flighty,—quite flighty\n",
      "enough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you ever see her in it, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How could I,” he returned, forced to the admission, “when I never see\n",
      "her in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!”\n",

      "“Goodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, don’t you know,” said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, “that when I have\n",
      "been there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the\n",
      "door has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don’t say you\n",
      "don’t know _that_, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did\n",
      "you play at, boy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We played with flags,” I said. (I beg to observe that I think of\n",
      "myself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Flags!” echoed my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said I. “Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and\n",
      "Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out\n",
      "at the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Swords!” repeated my sister. “Where did you get swords from?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Out of a cupboard,” said I. “And I saw pistols in it,—and jam,—and\n",
      "pills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up\n",
      "with candles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s true, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. “That’s the\n",
      "state of the case, for that much I’ve seen myself.” And then they both\n",
      "stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my\n",
      "countenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers\n",
      "with my right hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have\n",
      "betrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that\n",
      "there was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement\n",
      "but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear\n",
      "in the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the\n",
      "marvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I\n",
      "escaped. The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to\n",
      "have a cup of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own\n",
      "mind than for the gratification of his, related my pretended\n",
      "experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the\n",
      "kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only\n",
      "as regarded him,—not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards\n",
      "Joe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat\n",
      "debating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham’s\n",
      "acquaintance and favour. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would “do\n",
      "something” for me; their doubts related to the form that something\n",
      "would take. My sister stood out for “property.” Mr. Pumblechook was in\n",
      "favour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel\n",
      "trade,—say, the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the\n",
      "deepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I\n",
      "might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the\n",
      "veal-cutlets. “If a fool’s head can’t express better opinions than\n",
      "that,” said my sister, “and you have got any work to do, you had better\n",
      "go and do it.” So he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing\n",
      "up, I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had\n",
      "done for the night. Then I said, “Before the fire goes out, Joe, I\n",
      "should like to tell you something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Should you, Pip?” said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.\n",
      "“Then tell us. What is it, Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joe,” said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting\n",
      "it between my finger and thumb, “you remember all that about Miss\n",
      "Havisham’s?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remember?” said Joe. “I believe you! Wonderful!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a terrible thing, Joe; it ain’t true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you telling of, Pip?” cried Joe, falling back in the greatest\n",
      "amazement. “You don’t mean to say it’s—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes I do; it’s lies, Joe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But not all of it? Why sure you don’t mean to say, Pip, that there was\n",
      "no black welwet co—eh?” For, I stood shaking my head. “But at least\n",
      "there was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,” said Joe, persuasively, “if there\n",
      "warn’t no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Joe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A dog?” said Joe. “A puppy? Come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.\n",
      "“Pip, old chap! This won’t do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect\n",
      "to go to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s terrible, Joe; ain’t it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Terrible?” cried Joe. “Awful! What possessed you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know what possessed me, Joe,” I replied, letting his shirt\n",
      "sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;\n",
      "“but I wish you hadn’t taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I\n",
      "wish my boots weren’t so thick nor my hands so coarse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn’t been\n",
      "able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to\n",
      "me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’s\n",
      "who was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that\n",
      "I knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the\n",
      "lies had come of it somehow, though I didn’t know how.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal\n",
      "with as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of\n",
      "metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s one thing you may be sure of, Pip,” said Joe, after some\n",
      "rumination, “namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn’t\n",
      "ought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to\n",
      "the same. Don’t you tell no more of ’em, Pip. _That_ ain’t the way to\n",
      "get out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don’t make\n",
      "it out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You’re oncommon\n",
      "small. Likewise you’re a oncommon scholar.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I’ve\n",
      "seen letters—Ah! and from gentlefolks!—that I’ll swear weren’t wrote in\n",
      "print,” said Joe.\n",
      "\n",

      "that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Pip,” said Joe, “be it so or be it son’t, you must be a common\n",
      "scholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon\n",
      "his throne, with his crown upon his ed, can’t sit and write his acts of\n",
      "Parliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted\n",
      "Prince, with the alphabet.—Ah!” added Joe, with a shake of the head\n",
      "that was full of meaning, “and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.\n",
      "And _I_ know what that is to do, though I can’t say I’ve exactly done\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged\n",
      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,” pursued Joe,\n",
      "reflectively, “mightn’t be the better of continuing for to keep company\n",
      "with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon\n",

      "\n",
      "“(I’m sorry there weren’t a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or\n",
      "mightn’t be, is a thing as can’t be looked into now, without putting\n",
      "your sister on the Rampage; and that’s a thing not to be thought of as\n",

      "that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to\n",
      "get out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous\n",
      "conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle’s\n",
      "great-aunt’s at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to\n",
      "get on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she\n",
      "would impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging\n",
      "of girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her\n",
      "promise within five minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt\n",
      "may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and\n",
      "put straws down one another’s backs, until Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt\n",
      "collected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with\n",
      "a birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,\n",
      "the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand\n",
      "to hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a\n",
      "little spelling,—that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this\n",
      "volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt fell into a state of\n",
      "coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils\n",
      "then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the\n",
      "subject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the\n",
      "hardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a\n",
      "rush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they\n",
      "had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more\n",
      "illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have\n",
      "since met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various\n",
      "specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part\n",
      "of the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between\n",
      "Biddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave\n",
      "out the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,—or\n",
      "what we couldn’t—in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,\n",
      "shrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or\n",
      "reverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had\n",
      "lasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt,\n",
      "who staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was\n",
      "understood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into\n",
      "the air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that\n",
      "there was no prohibition against any pupil’s entertaining himself with\n",
      "a slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not\n",
      "easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of\n",
      "the little general shop in which the classes were holden—and which was\n",
      "also Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s sitting-room and bedchamber—being but\n",
      "faintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle\n",
      "and no snuffers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under\n",
      "these circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very\n",
      "evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some\n",
      "information from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of\n",
      "moist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D\n",
      "which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I\n",
      "supposed, until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe\n",
      "liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders\n",
      "from my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that\n",
      "evening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the\n",
      "Three Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk\n",
      "scores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to\n",
      "be never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and\n",
      "had grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our\n",
      "country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it\n",
      "to account.\n",
      "\n",
      "It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at\n",
      "these records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I\n",
      "merely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the\n",
      "end of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and\n",
      "where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a\n",
      "stranger. Joe greeted me as usual with “Halloa, Pip, old chap!” and the\n",
      "moment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was\n",
      "all on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were\n",
      "taking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his\n",
      "mouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away\n",
      "and looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he\n",
      "nodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit\n",
      "down there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of\n",
      "resort, I said “No, thank you, sir,” and fell into the space Joe made\n",
      "for me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,\n",
      "and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again\n",
      "when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg—in a very odd way, as\n",
      "it struck me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You was saying,” said the strange man, turning to Joe, “that you was a\n",
      "blacksmith.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. I said it, you know,” said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’ll you drink, Mr.—? You didn’t mention your name, by the bye.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. “What’ll\n",
      "you drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Joe, “to tell you the truth, I ain’t much in the habit of\n",
      "drinking at anybody’s expense but my own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Habit? No,” returned the stranger, “but once and away, and on a\n",
      "Saturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wouldn’t wish to be stiff company,” said Joe. “Rum.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rum,” repeated the stranger. “And will the other gentleman originate a\n",
      "sentiment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rum,” said Mr. Wopsle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Three Rums!” cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. “Glasses\n",
      "round!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This other gentleman,” observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,\n",
      "“is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at\n",
      "church.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aha!” said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. “The\n",
      "lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s it,” said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his\n",
      "legs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping\n",
      "broad-brimmed traveller’s hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over\n",
      "his head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he\n",
      "looked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a\n",
      "half-laugh, come into his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a\n",
      "solitary country towards the river.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most marshes is solitary,” said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or\n",
      "vagrants of any sort, out there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Joe; “none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don’t\n",
      "find _them_, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;\n",
      "but not warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seems you have been out after such?” asked the stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once,” returned Joe. “Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;\n",
      "we went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn’t us,\n",
      "Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Joe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger looked at me again,—still cocking his eye, as if he were\n",
      "expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,—and said, “He’s a\n",
      "likely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pip,” said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Christened Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, not christened Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Surname Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Joe, “it’s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a\n",
      "infant, and is called by.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Son of yours?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in\n",
      "anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at\n",
      "the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was\n",
      "discussed over pipes,—“well—no. No, he ain’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nevvy?” said the strange man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, “he\n",
      "is not—no, not to deceive you, he is _not_—my nevvy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the Blue Blazes is he?” asked the stranger. Which appeared to me\n",
      "to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about\n",
      "relationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female\n",
      "relations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and\n",
      "Joe. Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most\n",
      "terrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to\n",
      "think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, “—as\n",
      "the poet says.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he\n",
      "considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and\n",
      "poke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing\n",
      "who visited at our house should always have put me through the same\n",
      "inflammatory process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to\n",
      "mind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our\n",
      "social family circle, but some large-handed person took some such\n",
      "ophthalmic steps to patronise me.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at\n",
      "me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me\n",
      "down. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,\n",
      "until the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his\n",
      "shot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was\n",
      "pointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at\n",
      "me, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it\n",
      "and he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but _with a\n",
      "file_.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it\n",
      "he wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe’s\n",
      "file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the\n",
      "instrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on\n",
      "his settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally\n",
      "about turnips.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause\n",
      "before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights,\n",
      "which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on\n",
      "Saturdays than at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water\n",
      "running out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,” said the strange man. “I think I’ve\n",
      "got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the\n",
      "boy shall have it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some\n",
      "crumpled paper, and gave it to me. “Yours!” said he. “Mind! Your own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,\n",
      "and holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr.\n",
      "Wopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look\n",
      "with his aiming eye,—no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may\n",
      "be done with an eye by hiding it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the way home, if I had been in a humour for talking, the talk must\n",
      "have been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of\n",
      "the Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide\n",
      "open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in a\n",
      "manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old\n",
      "acquaintance, and could think of nothing else.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in\n",
      "the kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to\n",
      "tell her about the bright shilling. “A bad un, I’ll be bound,” said\n",
      "Mrs. Joe triumphantly, “or he wouldn’t have given it to the boy! Let’s\n",
      "look at it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. “But what’s\n",
      "this?” said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the\n",
      "paper. “Two One-Pound notes?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to\n",
      "have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets\n",
      "in the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the\n",
      "Jolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat\n",
      "down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty\n",
      "sure that the man would not be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,\n",
      "Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.\n",
      "Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under\n",
      "some dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in\n",
      "the state parlour. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and\n",
      "many a night and day.\n",

      "I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the\n",
      "strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the\n",
      "guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of\n",
      "conspiracy with convicts,—a feature in my low career that I had\n",
      "previously forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed\n",
      "me that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed\n",
      "myself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham’s, next Wednesday; and in\n",
      "my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who\n",

      "At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham’s, and my hesitating\n",
      "ring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting me,\n",
      "as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage\n",
      "where her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the\n",
      "candle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously\n",
      "saying, “You are to come this way to-day,” and took me to quite another\n",
      "part of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square\n",
      "basement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,\n",
      "however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and\n",
      "opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in a\n",
      "small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a\n",
      "detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the\n",
      "manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the\n",
      "outer wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham’s room, and\n",
      "like Miss Havisham’s watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a\n",
      "low ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in\n",
      "the room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, “You are to go and\n",
      "stand there boy, till you are wanted.” “There”, being the window, I\n",
      "crossed to it, and stood “there,” in a very uncomfortable state of\n",
      "mind, looking out.\n",
      "\n",
      "It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the\n",
      "neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree\n",
      "that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new\n",
      "growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different colour, as if\n",
      "that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This\n",
      "was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been\n",
      "some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;\n",
      "but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of\n",
      "garden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the\n",
      "window, as if it pelted me for coming there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that\n",
      "its other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room\n",
      "except the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in\n",
      "all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had\n",
      "been standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me\n",
      "that they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended\n",
      "not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the\n",
      "admission that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to\n",
      "be a toady and humbug.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody’s pleasure,\n",
      "and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to\n",
      "repress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded\n",
      "me of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I\n",
      "found when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.\n",
      "Indeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had\n",
      "any features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor dear soul!” said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my\n",
      "sister’s. “Nobody’s enemy but his own!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be much more commendable to be somebody else’s enemy,” said\n",
      "the gentleman; “far more natural.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cousin Raymond,” observed another lady, “we are to love our\n",
      "neighbour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sarah Pocket,” returned Cousin Raymond, “if a man is not his own\n",
      "neighbour, who is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),\n",
      "“The idea!” But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea\n",
      "too. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and\n",
      "emphatically, “_Very_ true!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor soul!” Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been\n",
      "looking at me in the mean time), “he is so very strange! Would anyone\n",
      "believe that when Tom’s wife died, he actually could not be induced to\n",
      "see the importance of the children’s having the deepest of trimmings to\n",
      "their mourning? ‘Good Lord!’ says he, ‘Camilla, what can it signify so\n",
      "long as the poor bereaved little things are in black?’ So like Matthew!\n",
      "The idea!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good points in him, good points in him,” said Cousin Raymond; “Heaven\n",
      "forbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never\n",
      "will have, any sense of the proprieties.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know I was obliged,” said Camilla,—“I was obliged to be firm. I\n",
      "said, ‘It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.’ I told him that,\n",
      "without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from\n",
      "breakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out\n",
      "in his violent way, and said, with a D, ‘Then do as you like.’ Thank\n",
      "Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly\n",
      "went out in a pouring rain and bought the things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_He_ paid for them, did he not?” asked Estella.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,” returned\n",
      "Camilla. “_I_ bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,\n",
      "when I wake up in the night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or\n",
      "call along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the\n",
      "conversation and caused Estella to say to me, “Now, boy!” On my turning\n",
      "round, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went\n",
      "out, I heard Sarah Pocket say, “Well I am sure! What next!” and Camilla\n",
      "add, with indignation, “Was there ever such a fancy! The i-d_e_-a!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella\n",
      "stopped all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting\n",
      "manner, with her face quite close to mine,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, miss?” I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Am I pretty?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; I think you are very pretty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Am I insulting?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so much so as you were last time,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so much so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face\n",
      "with such force as she had, when I answered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now?” said she. “You little coarse monster, what do you think of me\n",
      "now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall not tell you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said I, “that’s not it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t you cry again, you little wretch?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I’ll never cry for you again,” said I. Which was, I suppose,\n",
      "as false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for\n",
      "her then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going\n",
      "up, we met a gentleman groping his way down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whom have we here?” asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A boy,” said Estella.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an\n",
      "exceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chin\n",
      "in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the\n",
      "light of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head,\n",
      "and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn’t lie down but stood up\n",
      "bristling. His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were\n",
      "disagreeably sharp and suspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and\n",
      "strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he\n",
      "had let them. He was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresight\n",
      "then, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I had\n",
      "this opportunity of observing him well.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boy of the neighbourhood? Hey?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do _you_ come here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Havisham sent for me, sir,” I explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and\n",
      "you’re a bad set of fellows. Now mind!” said he, biting the side of his\n",
      "great forefinger as he frowned at me, “you behave yourself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With those words, he released me—which I was glad of, for his hand\n",
      "smelt of scented soap—and went his way downstairs. I wondered whether\n",
      "he could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn’t be a doctor, or he\n",
      "would have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much\n",
      "time to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham’s room,\n",
      "where she and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella\n",
      "left me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham\n",
      "cast her eyes upon me from the dressing-table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So!” she said, without being startled or surprised: “the days have\n",
      "worn away, have they?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am. To-day is—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, there, there!” with the impatient movement of her fingers. “I\n",
      "don’t want to know. Are you ready to play?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was obliged to answer in some confusion, “I don’t think I am, ma’am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at cards again?” she demanded, with a searching look.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am; I could do that, if I was wanted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy,” said Miss Havisham,\n",
      "impatiently, “and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to\n",
      "find for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then go into that opposite room,” said she, pointing at the door\n",
      "behind me with her withered hand, “and wait there till I come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.\n",
      "From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had\n",
      "an airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in\n",
      "the damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than\n",
      "to burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed\n",
      "colder than the clearer air,—like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry\n",
      "branches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the\n",
      "chamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its\n",
      "darkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but\n",
      "every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and\n",
      "dropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a\n",
      "tablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the\n",
      "house and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece\n",
      "of some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily\n",
      "overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,\n",
      "as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its\n",
      "seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with\n",
      "blotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some\n",
      "circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in\n",
      "the spider community.\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same\n",
      "occurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles\n",
      "took no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a\n",
      "ponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of\n",
      "hearing, and not on terms with one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching\n",
      "them from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.\n",
      "In her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned,\n",
      "and she looked like the Witch of the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This,” said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, “is where\n",
      "I will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and\n",
      "there and die at once, the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork\n",
      "at the Fair, I shrank under her touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you think that is?” she asked me, again pointing with her\n",
      "stick; “that, where those cobwebs are?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t guess what it is, ma’am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,\n",
      "leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, “Come, come, come!\n",
      "Walk me, walk me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss\n",
      "Havisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and\n",
      "she leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have\n",
      "been an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.\n",
      "Pumblechook’s chaise-cart.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not physically strong, and after a little time said, “Slower!”\n",
      "Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she\n",
      "twitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to\n",
      "believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a\n",
      "while she said, “Call Estella!” so I went out on the landing and roared\n",
      "that name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light\n",
      "appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round\n",
      "and round the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should\n",
      "have felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the\n",
      "three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn’t know\n",
      "what to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havisham\n",
      "twitched my shoulder, and we posted on,—with a shame-faced\n",
      "consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Miss Havisham,” said Miss Sarah Pocket. “How well you look!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not,” returned Miss Havisham. “I am yellow skin and bone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she\n",
      "murmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, “Poor dear\n",
      "soul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how are _you_?” said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to\n",
      "Camilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss\n",
      "Havisham wouldn’t stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly\n",
      "obnoxious to Camilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, Miss Havisham,” she returned, “I am as well as can be\n",
      "expected.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, what’s the matter with you?” asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding\n",
      "sharpness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing worth mentioning,” replied Camilla. “I don’t wish to make a\n",
      "display of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in\n",
      "the night than I am quite equal to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then don’t think of me,” retorted Miss Havisham.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very easily said!” remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a\n",
      "hitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. “Raymond is a\n",
      "witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.\n",
      "Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings\n",
      "and nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with\n",
      "anxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,\n",
      "I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure I\n",
      "wish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night—The\n",
      "idea!” Here, a burst of tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and\n",
      "him I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this\n",
      "point, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, “Camilla, my\n",
      "dear, it is well known that your family feelings are gradually\n",
      "undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than\n",
      "the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not aware,” observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but\n",
      "once, “that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that\n",
      "person, my dear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated\n",
      "old woman, with a small face that might have been made of\n",
      "walnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat’s without the whiskers,\n",
      "supported this position by saying, “No, indeed, my dear. Hem!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thinking is easy enough,” said the grave lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is easier, you know?” assented Miss Sarah Pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes, yes!” cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to\n",
      "rise from her legs to her bosom. “It’s all very true! It’s a weakness\n",
      "to be so affectionate, but I can’t help it. No doubt my health would be\n",
      "much better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn’t change my disposition\n",
      "if I could. It’s the cause of much suffering, but it’s a consolation to\n",
      "know I posses it, when I wake up in the night.” Here another burst of\n",
      "feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going\n",
      "round and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the\n",
      "visitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s Matthew!” said Camilla. “Never mixing with any natural ties,\n",
      "never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa\n",
      "with my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my\n",
      "head over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don’t know\n",
      "where—”\n",
      "\n",
      "(“Much higher than your head, my love,” said Mr. Camilla.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of\n",
      "Matthew’s strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really I must say I should think not!” interposed the grave lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, my dear,” added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious\n",
      "personage), “the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to\n",
      "thank you, my love?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,” resumed\n",
      "Camilla, “I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond\n",
      "is a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total\n",
      "inefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte\n",
      "tuner’s across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even\n",
      "supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,—and now to be told—”\n",
      "Here Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemical\n",
      "as to the formation of new combinations there.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and\n",
      "herself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great\n",
      "influence in bringing Camilla’s chemistry to a sudden end.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Matthew will come and see me at last,” said Miss Havisham, sternly,\n",
      "“when I am laid on that table. That will be his place,—there,” striking\n",
      "the table with her stick, “at my head! And yours will be there! And\n",
      "your husband’s there! And Sarah Pocket’s there! And Georgiana’s there!\n",
      "Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast\n",
      "upon me. And now go!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in\n",
      "a new place. She now said, “Walk me, walk me!” and we went on again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose there’s nothing to be done,” exclaimed Camilla, “but comply\n",
      "and depart. It’s something to have seen the object of one’s love and\n",
      "duty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy\n",
      "satisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have\n",
      "that comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a\n",
      "display of my feelings, but it’s very hard to be told one wants to\n",
      "feast on one’s relations,—as if one was a Giant,—and to be told to go.\n",
      "The bare idea!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving\n",
      "bosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I\n",
      "supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of\n",
      "view, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah\n",
      "Pocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was\n",
      "too knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful\n",
      "slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah\n",
      "Pocket then made her separate effect of departing with, “Bless you,\n",
      "Miss Havisham dear!” and with a smile of forgiving pity on her\n",
      "walnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked\n",
      "with her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she\n",
      "stopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it\n",
      "some seconds,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is my birthday, Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t suffer it to be spoken of. I don’t suffer those who were here\n",
      "just now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but\n",
      "they dare not refer to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course _I_ made no further effort to refer to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of\n",
      "decay,” stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the\n",
      "table, but not touching it, “was brought here. It and I have worn away\n",
      "together. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of\n",
      "mice have gnawed at me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking\n",
      "at the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; the\n",
      "once white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state\n",
      "to crumble under a touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When the ruin is complete,” said she, with a ghastly look, “and when\n",
      "they lay me dead, in my bride’s dress on the bride’s table,—which shall\n",
      "be done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,—so much the\n",
      "better if it is done on this day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own\n",
      "figure lying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she too\n",
      "remained quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time.\n",
      "In the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in\n",
      "its remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I\n",
      "might presently begin to decay.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an\n",
      "instant, Miss Havisham said, “Let me see you two play cards; why have\n",
      "you not begun?” With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as\n",
      "before; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham\n",
      "watched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella’s beauty, and\n",
      "made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella’s breast and\n",
      "hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that she\n",
      "did not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games,\n",
      "a day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard\n",
      "to be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left\n",
      "to wander about as I liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which\n",
      "I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last\n",
      "occasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I saw\n",
      "one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let the\n",
      "visitors out,—for she had returned with the keys in her hand,—I\n",
      "strolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a\n",
      "wilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,\n",
      "which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of\n",
      "weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a\n",
      "weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but\n",
      "a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal\n",
      "corner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for\n",
      "a moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,\n",
      "and found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a\n",
      "pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside\n",
      "me. He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him,\n",
      "and I now saw that he was inky.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halloa!” said he, “young fellow!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be\n",
      "best answered by itself, _I_ said, “Halloa!” politely omitting young\n",
      "fellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who let _you_ in?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Estella.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who gave you leave to prowl about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Estella.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come and fight,” said the pale young gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "What could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question\n",
      "since; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was so\n",
      "astonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a\n",
      "spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop a minute, though,” he said, wheeling round before we had gone\n",
      "many paces. “I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it\n",
      "is!” In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against\n",
      "one another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my\n",
      "hair, slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my\n",
      "stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was\n",
      "unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was\n",
      "particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit\n",
      "out at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, “Aha! Would\n",
      "you?” and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite\n",
      "unparalleled within my limited experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Laws of the game!” said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to\n",
      "his right. “Regular rules!” Here, he skipped from his right leg on to\n",
      "his left. “Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!” Here,\n",
      "he dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I\n",
      "looked helplessly at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt\n",
      "morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have\n",
      "had no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to\n",
      "consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I\n",
      "followed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by\n",
      "the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking\n",
      "me if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he\n",
      "begged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned\n",
      "with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. “Available for\n",
      "both,” he said, placing these against the wall. And then fell to\n",
      "pulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a\n",
      "manner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although he did not look very healthy,—having pimples on his face, and\n",
      "a breaking out at his mouth,—these dreadful preparations quite appalled\n",
      "me. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he\n",
      "had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For\n",
      "the rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded for\n",
      "battle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in\n",
      "advance of the rest of him as to development.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every\n",
      "demonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were\n",
      "minutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,\n",
      "as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back,\n",
      "looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly\n",
      "fore-shortened.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with a\n",
      "great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest\n",
      "surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,\n",
      "looking up at me out of a black eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "His spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no\n",
      "strength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked\n",
      "down; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or\n",
      "drinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in\n",
      "seconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air\n",
      "and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at\n",
      "last. He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I\n",
      "hit him, the harder I hit him; but he came up again and again and\n",
      "again, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head\n",
      "against the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up and\n",
      "turned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;\n",
      "but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at the\n",
      "same time panting out, “That means you have won.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the\n",
      "contest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go\n",
      "so far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of\n",
      "savage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly\n",
      "wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, “Can I help you?”\n",
      "and he said “No thankee,” and I said “Good afternoon,” and _he_ said\n",
      "“Same to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.\n",
      "But she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her\n",
      "waiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though\n",
      "something had happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to the\n",
      "gate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come here! You may kiss me, if you like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone\n",
      "through a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was\n",
      "given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and\n",
      "that it was worth nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with\n",
      "the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the\n",
      "light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming\n",
      "against a black night-sky, and Joe’s furnace was flinging a path of\n",

      "My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman.\n",
      "The more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman\n",
      "on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the\n",
      "more certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt\n",
      "that the pale young gentleman’s blood was on my head, and that the Law\n",
      "would avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I\n",
      "had incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go\n",
      "stalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and\n",
      "pitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselves\n",
      "open to severe punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home,\n",
      "and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and\n",
      "trepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County\n",
      "Jail should pounce upon me. The pale young gentleman’s nose had stained\n",
      "my trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the\n",
      "dead of night. I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman’s\n",
      "teeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I\n",
      "devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance\n",
      "when I should be haled before the Judges.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of\n",
      "violence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of\n",
      "Justice, especially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush\n",
      "behind the gate;—whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal\n",
      "vengeance for an outrage done to her house, might rise in those\n",
      "grave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:—whether\n",
      "suborned boys—a numerous band of mercenaries—might be engaged to fall\n",
      "upon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;—it was high\n",
      "testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman,\n",
      "that I never imagined _him_ accessory to these retaliations; they\n",
      "always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his,\n",
      "goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the\n",
      "family features.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, go to Miss Havisham’s I must, and go I did. And behold!\n",
      "nothing came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way,\n",
      "and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I\n",
      "found the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in\n",
      "at the windows of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped\n",
      "by the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner\n",
      "where the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the\n",
      "young gentleman’s existence. There were traces of his gore in that\n",
      "spot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the broad landing between Miss Havisham’s own room and that other\n",
      "room in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,—a\n",
      "light chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed\n",
      "there since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular\n",
      "occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired\n",
      "of walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and\n",
      "across the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over\n",
      "again, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as\n",
      "long as three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general\n",
      "mention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled\n",
      "that I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes,\n",

      "As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more\n",

      "believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know\n",
      "everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that\n",
      "desirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer\n",
      "my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,—or anything\n",

      "yes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when\n",

      "that relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure\n",
      "of beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the\n",

      "I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or\n",

      "to Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good\n",
      "fellow,—I _know_ I was ashamed of him,—when I saw that Estella stood at\n",
      "the back of Miss Havisham’s chair, and that her eyes laughed\n",

      "familiar expression were applied to Miss Havisham,—“and now, old chap,\n",
      "may we do our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and\n",
      "another, and by them which your liberal present—have-conweyed—to be—for\n",
      "the satisfaction of mind-of—them as never—” here Joe showed that he\n",
      "felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly\n",
      "rescued himself with the words, “and from myself far be it!” These\n",

      "How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I\n",
      "know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs\n",
      "instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went\n",
      "after him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the\n",
      "gate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the\n",
      "daylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,\n",
      "“Astonishing!” And there he remained so long saying, “Astonishing” at\n",
      "intervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming\n",
      "back. At length he prolonged his remark into “Pip, I do assure _you_\n",

      "able to walk away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have reason to think that Joe’s intellects were brightened by the\n",
      "encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook’s\n",
      "he invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in what\n",
      "took place in Mr. Pumblechook’s parlour: where, on our presenting\n",
      "ourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?” cried my sister, addressing us both at once. “And what’s\n",

      "society as this, I am sure I do!”\n",
      "\n",

      "too.\n",

      "seed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was\n",
      "a mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the\n",

      "Barnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively\n",
      "apologetic, Pumblechook’s indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle,\n",

      "maudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating\n",
      "circumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every\n",
      "occasion; it became sheer monomania in my master’s daughter to care a\n",
      "button for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating\n",
      "conduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general\n",
      "feebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle\n",
      "had closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his\n",
      "head, and saying, “Take warning, boy, take warning!” as if it were a\n",

      "on the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose\n",

      "came upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halloa!” we said, stopping. “Orlick there?”\n",

      "have been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all\n",

      "his half-holiday up and down town?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said he, “all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn’t see\n",

      "is going again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the Hulks?” said I.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the\n",
      "well-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily\n",
      "rolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing\n",
      "and threatening the fugitives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A good night for cutting off in,” said Orlick. “We’d be puzzled how to\n",
      "bring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in\n",
      "silence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening’s\n",
      "tragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick,\n",
      "with his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very\n",
      "dark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the\n",
      "sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled\n",
      "sulkily along the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my\n",
      "thoughts. Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game\n",
      "on Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick\n",
      "sometimes growled, “Beat it out, beat it out,—Old Clem! With a clink\n",
      "for the stout,—Old Clem!” I thought he had been drinking, but he was\n",
      "not drunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us\n",
      "past the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find—it being\n",
      "eleven o’clock—in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and\n",
      "unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered\n",
      "about. Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter (surmising that\n",
      "a convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s something wrong,” said he, without stopping, “up at your\n",

      "We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no\n",
      "stop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole\n",
      "village was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there\n",
      "was Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst\n",
      "of the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,\n",
      "and so I became aware of my sister,—lying without sense or movement on\n",
      "the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on\n",
      "the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was\n",

      "\n",
      "With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to\n",
      "believe that _I_ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,\n",
      "or at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under\n",
      "obligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than\n",
      "any one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began\n",
      "to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all\n",
      "sides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a\n",
      "quarter after eight o’clock to a quarter before ten. While he was\n",
      "there, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had\n",
      "exchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home. The man could not\n",
      "be more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into\n",
      "dense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been\n",
      "before nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found\n",
      "her struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The\n",
      "fire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle\n",
      "very long; the candle, however, had been blown out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond\n",
      "the blowing out of the candle,—which stood on a table between the door\n",
      "and my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and\n",
      "was struck,—was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such\n",
      "as she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one\n",
      "remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with\n",
      "something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were\n",
      "dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable\n",
      "violence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when\n",
      "Joe picked her up, was a convict’s leg-iron which had been filed\n",
      "asunder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith’s eye, declared it to have\n",
      "been filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the\n",
      "Hulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe’s opinion was\n",
      "corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the\n",
      "prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they\n",
      "claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been\n",
      "worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further,\n",

      "Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed\n",
      "the iron to be my convict’s iron,—the iron I had seen and heard him\n",
      "filing at, on the marshes,—but my mind did not accuse him of having put\n",
      "it to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have\n",
      "become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.\n",

      "picked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the\n",
      "evening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and\n",
      "he had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against\n",
      "him, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with\n",
      "everybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if\n",
      "he had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no\n",
      "dispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore\n",
      "them. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in\n",
      "so silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could\n",
      "look round.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however\n",
      "undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered\n",
      "unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I\n",
      "should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the\n",
      "story. For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally\n",
      "in the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The\n",
      "contention came, after all, to this;—the secret was such an old one\n",
      "now, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not\n",
      "tear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much\n",
      "mischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me\n",
      "if he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not\n",
      "believe it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets\n",
      "as a monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of\n",
      "course—for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing\n",
      "is always done?—and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see\n",

      "a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like\n",
      "authorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously\n",
      "wrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,\n",
      "and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead\n",
      "of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood\n",
      "about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks\n",
      "that filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration; and they had a\n",
      "mysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as\n",

      "Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay\n",
      "very ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects\n",
      "multiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of\n",
      "the realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and\n",
      "her speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as\n",
      "to be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always\n",
      "by her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate\n",
      "in speech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than\n",
      "indifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader,\n",
      "extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always\n",
      "called in to solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine,\n",
      "the substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among\n",
      "the mildest of my own mistakes.\n",

      "However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A\n",

      "were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a\n",
      "circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle’s\n",

      "whole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.\n",
      "Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly\n",
      "cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had\n",

      "cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe\n",
      "became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,\n",
      "and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that\n",
      "did him good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had\n",

      "nothing of it. Thus it was:—\n",
      "\n",
      "Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a\n",
      "character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost\n",
      "eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly\n",
      "wanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,\n",
      "from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the\n",
      "sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my\n",
      "sister’s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a\n",
      "qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one\n",
      "after another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the\n",
      "shape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and\n",
      "displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook\n",
      "her head to that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified\n",
      "lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this\n",

      "it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked\n",
      "thoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his\n",
      "initial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.\n",

      "arm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out,\n",
      "with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly\n",
      "distinguished him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I was\n",
      "disappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest\n",
      "anxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his\n",
      "being at length produced, and motioned that she would have him given\n",
      "something to drink. She watched his countenance as if she were\n",
      "particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his\n",
      "reception, she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and\n",
      "there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have\n",

      "I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was\n",
      "varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more\n",
      "remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying\n",
      "another visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty\n",
      "at the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she\n",
      "spoke of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words.\n",
      "The interview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I\n",
      "was going, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention\n",
      "at once that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking\n",
      "the guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than\n",
      "causing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after\n",
      "that, I took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened\n",
      "room, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that\n",
      "I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that\n",
      "mysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew\n",
      "older, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my\n",
      "thoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact.\n",
      "It bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate\n",
      "my trade and to be ashamed of home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her\n",
      "shoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands\n",
      "were always clean. She was not beautiful,—she was common, and could not\n",
      "be like Estella,—but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.\n",
      "She had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newly\n",
      "out of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myself\n",
      "one evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes\n",
      "that were very pretty and very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring\n",
      "at—writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at\n",
      "once by a sort of stratagem—and seeing Biddy observant of what I was\n",
      "about. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without\n",
      "laying it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy,” said I, “how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you\n",
      "are very clever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it that I manage? I don’t know,” returned Biddy, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "She managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not\n",
      "mean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you manage, Biddy,” said I, “to learn everything that I learn,\n",
      "and always to keep up with me?” I was beginning to be rather vain of my\n",
      "knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the\n",
      "greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have\n",
      "no doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I might as well ask you,” said Biddy, “how _you_ manage?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see\n",
      "me turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose I must catch it like a cough,” said Biddy, quietly; and went\n",
      "on with her sewing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at\n",
      "Biddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her\n",
      "rather an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was\n",
      "equally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our\n",
      "different sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I\n",
      "knew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith\n",
      "as I, or better.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are one of those, Biddy,” said I, “who make the most of every\n",
      "chance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how\n",
      "improved you are!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. “I was\n",
      "your first teacher though; wasn’t I?” said she, as she sewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy!” I exclaimed, in amazement. “Why, you are crying!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No I am not,” said Biddy, looking up and laughing. “What put that in\n",
      "your head?”\n",
      "\n",
      "What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it\n",
      "dropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been\n",
      "until Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of\n",
      "living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled\n",
      "the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the\n",
      "miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,\n",
      "with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and\n",
      "shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must\n",
      "have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first\n",
      "uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of\n",
      "course. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I\n",
      "looked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps\n",
      "I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too\n",
      "reserved, and should have patronised her more (though I did not use\n",
      "that precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Biddy,” I observed, when I had done turning it over, “you were my\n",
      "first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being\n",
      "together like this, in this kitchen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, poor thing!” replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to\n",
      "transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,\n",
      "making her more comfortable; “that’s sadly true!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said I, “we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.\n",
      "And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a\n",
      "quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook\n",
      "the care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out\n",
      "together. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed\n",
      "the village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the\n",
      "marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I\n",
      "began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my\n",
      "usual way. When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank,\n",
      "with the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it\n",
      "would have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time\n",
      "and place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy,” said I, after binding her to secrecy, “I want to be a\n",
      "gentleman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O, I wouldn’t, if I was you!” she returned. “I don’t think it would\n",
      "answer.”\n",

      "“Biddy,” said I, with some severity, “I have particular reasons for\n",

      "“You know best, Pip; but don’t you think you are happier as you are?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy,” I exclaimed, impatiently, “I am not at all happy as I am. I am\n",
      "disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to\n",
      "either, since I was bound. Don’t be absurd.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was I absurd?” said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; “I am sorry\n",
      "for that; I didn’t mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be\n",
      "comfortable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be\n",
      "comfortable—or anything but miserable—there, Biddy!—unless I can lead a\n",
      "very different sort of life from the life I lead now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s a pity!” said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind\n",
      "of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half\n",
      "inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave\n",
      "utterance to her sentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and I\n",
      "knew it was much to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I could have settled down,” I said to Biddy, plucking up the short\n",
      "grass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings\n",
      "out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,—“if I could have\n",
      "settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was\n",
      "little, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe\n",
      "would have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone\n",
      "partners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to\n",
      "keep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a\n",
      "fine Sunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for\n",
      "_you_; shouldn’t I, Biddy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for\n",
      "answer, “Yes; I am not over-particular.” It scarcely sounded\n",
      "flattering, but I knew she meant well.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Instead of that,” said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade\n",
      "or two, “see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable,\n",
      "and—what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had\n",
      "told me so!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more\n",
      "attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,” she\n",
      "remarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. “Who said it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I\n",
      "was going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I\n",
      "answered, “The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’s, and she’s more\n",
      "beautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I\n",
      "want to be a gentleman on her account.” Having made this lunatic\n",
      "confession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I\n",
      "had some thoughts of following it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?”\n",
      "Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” I moodily answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because, if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—but\n",
      "you know best—that might be better and more independently done by\n",
      "caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should\n",
      "think—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was\n",
      "perfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed\n",
      "village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and\n",
      "wisest of men fall every day?\n",
      "\n",
      "“It may be all quite true,” said I to Biddy, “but I admire her\n",
      "dreadfully.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good\n",
      "grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All\n",
      "the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and\n",
      "misplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my face\n",
      "right, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the\n",
      "pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.\n",
      "She put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by\n",
      "work, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my\n",
      "hair. Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with\n",
      "my face upon my sleeve I cried a little,—exactly as I had done in the\n",
      "brewery yard,—and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used\n",
      "by somebody, or by everybody; I can’t say which.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad of one thing,” said Biddy, “and that is, that you have felt\n",
      "you could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,\n",
      "and that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it\n",
      "and always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a\n",
      "poor one, and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been your\n",
      "teacher at the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would\n",
      "set. But it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her,\n",
      "and it’s of no use now.” So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from\n",
      "the bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, “Shall\n",
      "we walk a little farther, or go home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy,” I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving\n",
      "her a kiss, “I shall always tell you everything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Till you’re a gentleman,” said Biddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know I never shall be, so that’s always. Not that I have any\n",
      "occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,—as I\n",
      "told you at home the other night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.\n",
      "And then repeated, with her former pleasant change, “shall we walk a\n",
      "little farther, or go home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the\n",
      "summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very\n",
      "beautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and\n",
      "wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing\n",
      "beggar my neighbour by candle-light in the room with the stopped\n",
      "clocks, and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good\n",
      "for me if I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those\n",
      "remembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish\n",
      "what I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked\n",
      "myself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were\n",
      "beside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable?\n",
      "I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said\n",
      "to myself, “Pip, what a fool you are!”\n",
      "\n",
      "We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed\n",
      "right. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and\n",
      "somebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no\n",
      "pleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her\n",
      "own breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her\n",
      "much the better of the two?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy,” said I, when we were walking homeward, “I wish you could put\n",
      "me right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I could!” said Biddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,—you don’t mind my\n",
      "speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear, not at all!” said Biddy. “Don’t mind me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I could only get myself to do it, _that_ would be the thing for\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you never will, you see,” said Biddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would\n",
      "have done if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore\n",
      "observed I was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she _was_, and\n",
      "she said it decisively. In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet\n",
      "I took it rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and\n",
      "get over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate,\n",
      "or from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant\n",
      "way), Old Orlick.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halloa!” he growled, “where are you two going?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where should we be going, but home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” said he, “I’m jiggered if I don’t see you home!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of\n",
      "his. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of,\n",
      "but used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind,\n",
      "and convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger,\n",
      "I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he\n",
      "would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,\n",
      "“Don’t let him come; I don’t like him.” As I did not like him either, I\n",
      "took the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn’t want\n",
      "seeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of\n",
      "laughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little\n",
      "distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in\n",
      "that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give\n",
      "any account, I asked her why she did not like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,\n",
      "“because I—I am afraid he likes me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did he ever tell you he liked you?” I asked indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, “he never told me\n",
      "so; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not\n",
      "doubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon\n",
      "Old Orlick’s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on\n",
      "myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it makes no difference to you, you know,” said Biddy, calmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don’t like it; I don’t\n",
      "approve of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor I neither,” said Biddy. “Though _that_ makes no difference to\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly,” said I; “but I must tell you I should have no opinion of\n",
      "you, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances\n",
      "were favourable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that\n",
      "demonstration. He had struck root in Joe’s establishment, by reason of\n",
      "my sister’s sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him\n",
      "dismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as\n",
      "I had reason to know thereafter.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated\n",
      "its confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I\n",
      "was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the\n",
      "plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be\n",
      "ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and\n",
      "happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my\n",
      "disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was\n",
      "growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company\n",
      "with Biddy,—when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the\n",
      "Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and\n",
      "scatter my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and\n",
      "often before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in\n",
      "all directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss\n",
      "Havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out.\n",
      "\n",
      "If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my\n",
      "perplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was\n",
      "brought to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a\n",
      "Saturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three\n",
      "Jolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.\n",
      "Of that group I was one.\n",
      "\n",
      "A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued\n",
      "in blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in\n",
      "the description, and identified himself with every witness at the\n",
      "Inquest. He faintly moaned, “I am done for,” as the victim, and he\n",
      "barbarously bellowed, “I’ll serve you out,” as the murderer. He gave\n",
      "the medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner;\n",
      "and he piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard\n",
      "blows, to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding\n",
      "the mental competency of that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle’s\n",
      "hands, became Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. He enjoyed\n",
      "himself thoroughly, and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully\n",
      "comfortable. In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful\n",
      "Murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning\n",
      "over the back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an\n",
      "expression of contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great\n",
      "forefinger as he watched the group of faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done,\n",
      "“you have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He looked\n",
      "at everybody coldly and sarcastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Guilty, of course?” said he. “Out with it. Come!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” returned Mr. Wopsle, “without having the honour of your\n",
      "acquaintance, I do say Guilty.” Upon this we all took courage to unite\n",
      "in a confirmatory murmur.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know you do,” said the stranger; “I knew you would. I told you so.\n",
      "But now I’ll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know, that\n",
      "the law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is\n",
      "proved—proved—to be guilty?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” Mr. Wopsle began to reply, “as an Englishman myself, I—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. “Don’t evade\n",
      "the question. Either you know it, or you don’t know it. Which is it to\n",
      "be?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a\n",
      "bullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.\n",
      "Wopsle,—as it were to mark him out—before biting it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now!” said he. “Do you know it, or don’t you know it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly I know it,” replied Mr. Wopsle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly you know it. Then why didn’t you say so at first? Now, I’ll\n",
      "ask you another question,”—taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he\n",
      "had a right to him,—“_do_ you know that none of these witnesses have\n",
      "yet been cross-examined?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wopsle was beginning, “I can only say—” when the stranger stopped\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What? You won’t answer the question, yes or no? Now, I’ll try you\n",
      "again.” Throwing his finger at him again. “Attend to me. Are you aware,\n",
      "or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been\n",
      "cross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor\n",
      "opinion of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said the stranger, “I’ll help you. You don’t deserve help, but\n",
      "I’ll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it,” pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious\n",
      "manner, “the printed paper you have just been reading from?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Undoubtedly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Undoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it\n",
      "distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal\n",
      "advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I read that just now,” Mr. Wopsle pleaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don’t ask you what you read\n",
      "just now. You may read the Lord’s Prayer backwards, if you like,—and,\n",
      "perhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my\n",
      "friend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to the\n",
      "bottom, to the bottom.” (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of\n",
      "subterfuge.) “Well? Have you found it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here it is,” said Mr. Wopsle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it\n",
      "distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was\n",
      "instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come!\n",
      "Do you make that of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wopsle answered, “Those are not the exact words.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not the exact words!” repeated the gentleman bitterly. “Is that the\n",
      "exact substance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Mr. Wopsle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company\n",
      "with his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. “And now I\n",
      "ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that\n",
      "passage before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having\n",
      "pronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?”\n",
      "\n",
      "We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought\n",
      "him, and that he was beginning to be found out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that same man, remember,” pursued the gentleman, throwing his\n",
      "finger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,—“that same man might be summoned as a\n",
      "juryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed\n",
      "himself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon\n",
      "his pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly\n",
      "try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the\n",
      "prisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to the\n",
      "evidence, so help him God!”\n",
      "\n",

      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and\n",
      "with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of\n",
      "us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to\n",
      "disclose it, left the back of the settle, and came into the space\n",
      "between the two settles, in front of the fire, where he remained\n",
      "standing, his left hand in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of\n",
      "his right.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From information I have received,” said he, looking round at us as we\n",
      "all quailed before him, “I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith\n",
      "among you, by name Joseph—or Joe—Gargery. Which is the man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here is the man,” said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.\n",

      "“You have an apprentice,” pursued the stranger, “commonly known as Pip?\n",
      "Is he here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am here!” I cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger did not recognise me, but I recognised him as the\n",
      "gentleman I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit\n",
      "to Miss Havisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the\n",
      "settle, and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my\n",
      "shoulder, I checked off again in detail his large head, his dark\n",
      "complexion, his deep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large\n",
      "watch-chain, his strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the\n",
      "smell of scented soap on his great hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish to have a private conference with you two,” said he, when he\n",
      "had surveyed me at his leisure. “It will take a little time. Perhaps we\n",
      "had better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my\n",
      "communication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you\n",
      "please to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,\n",
      "and in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange\n",
      "gentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of\n",
      "his finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion\n",
      "as an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front\n",
      "door. Our conference was held in the state parlour, which was feebly\n",
      "lighted by one candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "It began with the strange gentleman’s sitting down at the table,\n",
      "drawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his\n",
      "pocket-book. He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little\n",
      "aside, after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to\n",
      "ascertain which was which.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My name,” he said, “is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am\n",
      "pretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I\n",
      "commence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice\n",
      "had been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you\n",
      "see me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I\n",
      "do. No less, no more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got\n",
      "up, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus\n",

      "\n",
      "“Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of\n",
      "this young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his\n",
      "indentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for\n",
      "so doing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip’s\n",
      "way,” said Joe, staring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,” returned Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers. “The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want\n",
      "anything?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The answer is,” returned Joe, sternly, “No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool\n",
      "for his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between\n",
      "breathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well,” said Mr. Jaggers. “Recollect the admission you have made,\n",

      "“Yes, I do keep a dog.”\n",

      "“Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.\n",
      "Bear that in mind, will you?” repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes\n",
      "and nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.\n",
      "“Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got\n",
      "to make is, that he has great expectations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am instructed to communicate to him,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\n",
      "finger at me sideways, “that he will come into a handsome property.\n",
      "Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that\n",
      "property, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of\n",

      "“Now, Mr. Pip,” pursued the lawyer, “I address the rest of what I have\n",
      "to say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request of\n",
      "the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the\n",
      "name of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great\n",
      "expectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have\n",
      "any objection, this is the time to mention it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,\n",
      "that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that\n",
      "the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a\n",
      "profound secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered\n",
      "to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first\n",
      "hand by word of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be\n",
      "carried out, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now,\n",
      "you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively\n",
      "prohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or\n",
      "reference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as _the_\n",
      "individual, in all the communications you may have with me. If you have\n",
      "a suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast.\n",
      "It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition\n",
      "are; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere\n",
      "whim. This is not for you to inquire into. The condition is laid down.\n",
      "Your acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is the\n",
      "only remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person from\n",
      "whom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwise\n",
      "responsible. That person is the person from whom you derive your\n",
      "expectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me.\n",
      "Again, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a\n",
      "rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, this is the time\n",
      "to mention it. Speak out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.”\n",
      "Though he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he\n",
      "still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and\n",
      "even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while\n",
      "he spoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my\n",
      "disparagement, if he only chose to mention them. “We come next, to mere\n",
      "details of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used the\n",
      "term ‘expectations’ more than once, you are not endowed with\n",
      "expectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money\n",
      "amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will\n",
      "please consider me your guardian. Oh!” for I was going to thank him, “I\n",
      "tell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn’t render\n",
      "them. It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance\n",
      "with your altered position, and that you will be alive to the\n",
      "importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said I had always longed for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,” he retorted;\n",
      "“keep to the record. If you long for it now, that’s enough. Am I\n",
      "answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper\n",
      "tutor? Is that it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I stammered yes, that was it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don’t think that\n",
      "wise, mind, but it’s my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom\n",
      "you would prefer to another?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt;\n",
      "so, I replied in the negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think\n",
      "might suit the purpose,” said Mr. Jaggers. “I don’t recommend him,\n",
      "observe; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is\n",
      "one Mr. Matthew Pocket.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham’s relation. The\n",
      "Matthew whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whose\n",
      "place was to be at Miss Havisham’s head, when she lay dead, in her\n",
      "bride’s dress on the bride’s table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know the name?” said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then\n",
      "shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "My answer was, that I had heard of the name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said he. “You have heard of the name. But the question is, what\n",
      "do you say of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his\n",
      "recommendation—\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my young friend!” he interrupted, shaking his great head very\n",
      "slowly. “Recollect yourself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him\n",
      "for his recommendation—\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my young friend,” he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning\n",
      "and smiling both at once,—“no, no, no; it’s very well done, but it\n",
      "won’t do; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not\n",
      "the word, Mr. Pip. Try another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his\n",
      "mention of Mr. Matthew Pocket—\n",
      "\n",
      "“_That_’s more like it!” cried Mr. Jaggers.—And (I added), I would\n",
      "gladly try that gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall be\n",
      "prepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London. When\n",
      "will you come to London?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that I\n",
      "supposed I could come directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“First,” said Mr. Jaggers, “you should have some new clothes to come\n",
      "in, and they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You’ll\n",
      "want some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them\n",
      "out on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time he\n",
      "had taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when he\n",
      "had pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _am_!” said Joe, in a very decided manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It were understood,” said Joe. “And it are understood. And it ever\n",
      "will be similar according.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what,” said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,—“what if it was in my\n",
      "instructions to make you a present, as compensation?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As compensation what for?” Joe demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the loss of his services.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have\n",
      "often thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or\n",
      "pat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. “Pip\n",
      "is that hearty welcome,” said Joe, “to go free with his services, to\n",
      "honour and fortun’, as no words can tell him. But if you think as Money\n",
      "can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child—what come\n",
      "to the forge—and ever the best of friends!—”\n",
      "\n",
      "O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I\n",
      "see you again, with your muscular blacksmith’s arm before your eyes,\n",
      "and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good\n",
      "faithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my\n",
      "arm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel’s\n",
      "wing!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future\n",
      "fortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I\n",
      "begged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the best\n",
      "of friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyes\n",
      "with his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but\n",
      "said not another word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognised in Joe the\n",
      "village idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said,\n",
      "weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half\n",
      "measures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in\n",
      "charge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the\n",
      "contrary you mean to say—” Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped\n",
      "by Joe’s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell\n",
      "pugilistic purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which I meantersay,” cried Joe, “that if you come into my place\n",
      "bull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if\n",
      "you’re a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay\n",
      "and stand or fall by!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to\n",
      "me, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any\n",
      "one whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a-going to be\n",
      "bull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when\n",
      "Joe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing any\n",
      "inclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory\n",
      "remarks. They were these.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here—as you are to be a\n",
      "gentleman—the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall\n",
      "receive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a\n",
      "hackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to\n",
      "me. Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the\n",
      "trust I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now,\n",
      "understand that, finally. Understand that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone\n",
      "on, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he\n",
      "was going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired\n",
      "carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halloa!” said he, facing round, “what’s the matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;\n",
      "so I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my\n",
      "taking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t mean in the village only, but up town?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said he. “No objection.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had\n",
      "already locked the front door and vacated the state parlour, and was\n",
      "seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at\n",
      "the burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the\n",
      "coals, and nothing was said for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at\n",
      "her needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next\n",
      "Joe in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the\n",
      "glowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the\n",
      "longer the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length I got out, “Joe, have you told Biddy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Pip,” returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his\n",
      "knees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to\n",
      "make off somewhere, “which I left it to yourself, Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would rather you told, Joe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pip’s a gentleman of fortun’ then,” said Joe, “and God bless him in\n",
      "it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked\n",
      "at me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily\n",
      "congratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their\n",
      "congratulations that I rather resented.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with\n",
      "the grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and\n",
      "say nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in\n",
      "good time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said,\n",
      "save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.\n",
      "Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work\n",
      "again, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining\n",
      "his knees, said, “Ay, ay, I’ll be ekervally partickler, Pip;” and then\n",
      "they congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at\n",
      "the notion of my being a gentleman that I didn’t half like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some\n",
      "idea of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts\n",
      "entirely failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times,\n",
      "and even repeated after Biddy, the words “Pip” and “Property.” But I\n",
      "doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I\n",
      "cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy\n",
      "became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.\n",
      "Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is\n",
      "possible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied\n",
      "with myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyhow, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,\n",
      "looking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and\n",
      "about what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I\n",
      "caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they\n",
      "often looked at me,—particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they\n",
      "were expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did\n",
      "by word or sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen\n",
      "door opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings\n",
      "to air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am\n",
      "afraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the\n",
      "rustic objects among which I had passed my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Saturday night,” said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese\n",
      "and beer. “Five more days, and then the day before _the_ day! They’ll\n",
      "soon go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Pip,” observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.\n",
      "“They’ll soon go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Soon, soon go,” said Biddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and\n",
      "order my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I’ll come and put\n",
      "them on there, or that I’ll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook’s. It\n",
      "would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure\n",
      "too, Pip,” said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese\n",
      "on it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper\n",
      "as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. “So might\n",
      "Wopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s just what I don’t want, Joe. They would make such a business of\n",
      "it,—such a coarse and common business,—that I couldn’t bear myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, that indeed, Pip!” said Joe. “If you couldn’t abear yourself—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister’s plate, “Have you\n",
      "thought about when you’ll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister\n",
      "and me? You will show yourself to us; won’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy,” I returned with some resentment, “you are so exceedingly quick\n",
      "that it’s difficult to keep up with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(“She always were quick,” observed Joe.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say\n",
      "that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,—most likely\n",
      "on the evening before I go away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an\n",
      "affectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I\n",
      "got into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a\n",
      "mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,\n",
      "for ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even\n",
      "at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind\n",
      "between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in\n",
      "so often between the forge and Miss Havisham’s, and Biddy and Estella.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and\n",
      "the room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I\n",
      "saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or\n",
      "two in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and\n",
      "light it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me\n",
      "that he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.\n",
      "\n",
      "He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his\n",
      "pipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew\n",
      "that they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing\n",
      "tone by both of them more than once. I would not have listened for\n",
      "more, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and\n",
      "sat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and\n",
      "strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the\n",
      "loneliest I had ever known.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe’s pipe\n",
      "floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,—not\n",
      "obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared\n",
      "together. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy\n",
      "bed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.\n",

      "Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,\n",
      "and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay\n",
      "heaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened\n",
      "between me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a\n",
      "misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and\n",
      "that, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or\n",
      "clean gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our\n",
      "approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After\n",
      "breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best\n",
      "parlour, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With\n",

      "felt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion\n",
      "for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after\n",
      "Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the\n",
      "low green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them\n",
      "one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner\n",
      "of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of\n",
      "condescension, upon everybody in the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my\n",
      "companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among\n",
      "those graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place\n",
      "recalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and\n",
      "badge! My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he\n",
      "had doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he was dead to\n",
      "me, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these\n",
      "grazing cattle,—though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a\n",
      "more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might\n",
      "stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great\n",
      "expectations,—farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,\n",
      "henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith’s work in\n",
      "general, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,\n",
      "lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham\n",
      "intended me for Estella, fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,\n",
      "smoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my\n",
      "eyes, and said,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“As being the last time, Pip, I thought I’d foller.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And Joe, I am very glad you did so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thankee, Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may be sure, dear Joe,” I went on, after we had shaken hands,\n",
      "“that I shall never forget you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, Pip!” said Joe, in a comfortable tone, “_I_’m sure of that.\n",
      "Ay, ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well\n",
      "round in a man’s mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time\n",
      "to get it well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn’t it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe’s being so mightily secure of\n",
      "me. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,\n",
      "“It does you credit, Pip,” or something of that sort. Therefore, I made\n",
      "no remark on Joe’s first head; merely saying as to his second, that the\n",
      "tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a\n",
      "gentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I\n",
      "were one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you though?” said Joe. “Astonishing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a pity now, Joe,” said I, “that you did not get on a little more,\n",
      "when we had our lessons here; isn’t it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I don’t know,” returned Joe. “I’m so awful dull. I’m only master\n",
      "of my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it’s\n",
      "no more of a pity now, than it was—this day twelvemonth—don’t you see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to\n",
      "do something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he had\n",
      "been better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly\n",
      "innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to\n",
      "Biddy in preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our\n",
      "little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a\n",
      "general way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never\n",
      "forget her, said I had a favour to ask of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And it is, Biddy,” said I, “that you will not omit any opportunity of\n",
      "helping Joe on, a little.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How helping him on?” asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! Joe is a dear good fellow,—in fact, I think he is the dearest\n",
      "fellow that ever lived,—but he is rather backward in some things. For\n",
      "instance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her\n",
      "eyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O, his manners! won’t his manners do then?” asked Biddy, plucking a\n",
      "black-currant leaf.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Biddy, they do very well here—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O! they _do_ very well here?” interrupted Biddy, looking closely at\n",
      "the leaf in her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hear me out,—but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I\n",
      "shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would\n",
      "hardly do him justice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And don’t you think he knows that?” asked Biddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most\n",
      "distant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy, what do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,—and the\n",
      "smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that\n",
      "evening in the little garden by the side of the lane,—said, “Have you\n",
      "never considered that he may be proud?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Proud?” I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O! there are many kinds of pride,” said Biddy, looking full at me and\n",
      "shaking her head; “pride is not all of one kind—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well? What are you stopping for?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not all of one kind,” resumed Biddy. “He may be too proud to let any\n",
      "one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills\n",
      "well and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it\n",
      "sounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I\n",
      "do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Biddy,” said I, “I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not\n",
      "expect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You\n",
      "are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can’t help\n",
      "showing it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you have the heart to think so,” returned Biddy, “say so. Say so\n",
      "over and over again, if you have the heart to think so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,” said I, in a\n",
      "virtuous and superior tone; “don’t put it off upon me. I am very sorry\n",
      "to see it, and it’s a—it’s a bad side of human nature. I did intend to\n",
      "ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was\n",
      "gone, of improving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am\n",
      "extremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,” I repeated. “It’s a—it’s a\n",
      "bad side of human nature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whether you scold me or approve of me,” returned poor Biddy, “you may\n",
      "equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at\n",
      "all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make no\n",
      "difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be\n",
      "unjust neither,” said Biddy, turning away her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in\n",
      "which sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to\n",
      "think I was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy,\n",
      "and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and\n",
      "took a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very\n",
      "sorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright\n",
      "fortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency\n",
      "to Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I\n",
      "had, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,\n",
      "and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his\n",
      "breakfast in the parlour behind his shop, and who did not think it\n",
      "worth his while to come out to me, but called me in to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. “How are\n",
      "you, and what can I do for you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and was\n",
      "slipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a\n",
      "prosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous\n",
      "little garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let\n",
      "into the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that\n",
      "heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Trabb,” said I, “it’s an unpleasant thing to have to mention,\n",
      "because it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome\n",
      "property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up\n",
      "from the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming,\n",
      "“Lord bless my soul!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going up to my guardian in London,” said I, casually drawing some\n",
      "guineas out of my pocket and looking at them; “and I want a fashionable\n",
      "suit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,” I added—otherwise I\n",
      "thought he might only pretend to make them, “with ready money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear sir,” said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened\n",
      "his arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each\n",
      "elbow, “don’t hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate\n",
      "you? Would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Trabb’s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.\n",
      "When I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his\n",
      "labours by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into\n",
      "the shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible\n",
      "corners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with\n",
      "any blacksmith, alive or dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold that noise,” said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, “or\n",
      "I’ll knock your head off!—Do me the favour to be seated, sir. Now,\n",
      "this,” said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out\n",
      "in a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand\n",
      "under it to show the gloss, “is a very sweet article. I can recommend\n",
      "it for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you\n",
      "shall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!” (To the boy, and with\n",
      "a dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant’s\n",
      "brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had\n",
      "deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.\n",
      "Then he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. “And let\n",
      "me have none of your tricks here,” said Mr. Trabb, “or you shall repent\n",
      "it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential\n",
      "confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an\n",
      "article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it\n",
      "would ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished\n",
      "fellow-townsman’s (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having\n",
      "worn. “Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,” said Mr.\n",
      "Trabb to the boy after that, “or shall I kick you out of the shop and\n",
      "bring them myself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb’s\n",
      "judgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured. For although Mr.\n",
      "Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented\n",
      "with it, he said apologetically that it “wouldn’t do under existing\n",
      "circumstances, sir,—wouldn’t do at all.” So, Mr. Trabb measured and\n",
      "calculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finest\n",
      "species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I\n",
      "felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his\n",
      "pains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles\n",
      "to Mr. Pumblechook’s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand\n",
      "upon the parlour lock, “I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be\n",
      "expected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a\n",
      "turn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem\n",
      "it. Good-morning, sir, much obliged.—Door!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what\n",
      "it meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his\n",
      "hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money\n",
      "was, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb’s boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this memorable event, I went to the hatter’s, and the\n",
      "bootmaker’s, and the hosier’s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard’s\n",
      "dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades. I also went\n",
      "to the coach-office and took my place for seven o’clock on Saturday\n",
      "morning. It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come\n",
      "into a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect,\n",
      "it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention\n",
      "diverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated his\n",
      "mind upon me. When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my\n",
      "steps towards Pumblechook’s, and, as I approached that gentleman’s\n",
      "place of business, I saw him standing at his door.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early with\n",
      "the chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He had\n",
      "prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlour, and he too ordered\n",
      "his shopman to “come out of the gangway” as my sacred person passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when\n",
      "he and I and the collation were alone, “I give you joy of your good\n",
      "fortune. Well deserved, well deserved!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of\n",
      "expressing himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To think,” said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for\n",
      "some moments, “that I should have been the humble instrument of leading\n",
      "up to this, is a proud reward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said\n",
      "or hinted, on that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook; “if you will allow me to\n",
      "call you so—”\n",
      "\n",
      "I murmured “Certainly,” and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands\n",
      "again, and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an\n",
      "emotional appearance, though it was rather low down, “My dear young\n",
      "friend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping\n",
      "the fact before the mind of Joseph.—Joseph!” said Mr. Pumblechook, in\n",
      "the way of a compassionate adjuration. “Joseph!! Joseph!!!” Thereupon\n",
      "he shook his head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in\n",
      "Joseph.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “you must be hungry,\n",
      "you must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the\n",
      "Boar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here’s one or two\n",
      "little things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise.\n",
      "But do I,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he\n",
      "had sat down, “see afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of\n",
      "happy infancy? And may I—_may_ I—?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was\n",
      "fervent, and then sat down again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here is wine,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune,\n",
      "and may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment! And yet I\n",
      "cannot,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, “see afore me One—and\n",
      "likewise drink to One—without again expressing—May I—_may_ I—?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his\n",
      "glass and turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned\n",
      "myself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more\n",
      "direct to my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of\n",
      "tongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and\n",
      "took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. “Ah! poultry,\n",
      "poultry! You little thought,” said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophising the\n",
      "fowl in the dish, “when you was a young fledgling, what was in store\n",
      "for you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this\n",
      "humble roof for one as—Call it a weakness, if you will,” said Mr.\n",
      "Pumblechook, getting up again, “but may I? _may_ I—?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so he\n",
      "did it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself\n",
      "with my knife, I don’t know.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And your sister,” he resumed, after a little steady eating, “which had\n",
      "the honour of bringing you up by hand! It’s a sad picter, to reflect\n",
      "that she’s no longer equal to fully understanding the honour. May—”\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll drink her health,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid\n",
      "with admiration, “that’s the way you know ’em, sir!” (I don’t know who\n",
      "Sir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person\n",
      "present); “that’s the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever\n",
      "forgiving and ever affable. It might,” said the servile Pumblechook,\n",
      "putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, “to a\n",
      "common person, have the appearance of repeating—but _may_ I—?”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. “Let\n",
      "us never be blind,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “to her faults of temper, but\n",
      "it is to be hoped she meant well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in\n",
      "the face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes\n",
      "sent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I\n",
      "mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,\n",
      "and he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he\n",
      "intimated, worthy of my confidence, and—in short, might he? Then he\n",
      "asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we\n",
      "had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he\n",
      "had ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken\n",
      "ten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he\n",
      "never had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of\n",
      "hearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling\n",
      "convinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a\n",
      "sensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask\n",
      "my advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was\n",
      "an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and\n",
      "seed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred\n",
      "before in that or any other neighbourhood. What alone was wanting to\n",
      "the realisation of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.\n",
      "Those were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him\n",
      "(Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through\n",
      "a sleeping partner, sir,—which sleeping partner would have nothing to\n",
      "do but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine the\n",
      "books,—and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his\n",
      "pocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,—it appeared to him that that\n",
      "might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with\n",
      "property, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?\n",
      "He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it\n",
      "as my opinion. “Wait a bit!” The united vastness and distinctness of\n",
      "this view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake\n",
      "hands with me, but said he really must,—and did.\n",
      "\n",
      "We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and\n",
      "over again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don’t know what mark), and\n",
      "to render me efficient and constant service (I don’t know what\n",
      "service). He also made known to me for the first time in my life, and\n",
      "certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had\n",
      "always said of me, “That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun’\n",
      "will be no common fortun’.” He said with a tearful smile that it was a\n",
      "singular thing to think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out\n",
      "into the air, with a dim perception that there was something unwonted\n",
      "in the conduct of the sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got\n",
      "to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook’s hailing me. He was a long way\n",
      "down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to\n",
      "stop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my dear friend,” said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.\n",
      "“Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without\n",
      "that affability on your part.—May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?\n",
      "_May_ I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young\n",
      "carter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed me\n",
      "and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the\n",
      "road; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge\n",
      "before I pursued my way home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little\n",
      "I possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that\n",
      "same afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want\n",
      "next morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I\n",
      "went to Mr. Pumblechook’s, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to\n",
      "Miss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook’s own room was given up to me to dress\n",
      "in, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My\n",
      "clothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new and\n",
      "eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a\n",
      "trifle short of the wearer’s expectation. But after I had had my new\n",
      "suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of\n",
      "posturing with Mr. Pumblechook’s very limited dressing-glass, in the\n",
      "futile endeavour to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being\n",
      "market morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off, Mr.\n",
      "Pumblechook was not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to\n",
      "leave, and was not likely to shake hands with him again before\n",
      "departing. This was all as it should be, and I went out in my new\n",
      "array, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious\n",
      "after all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Joe’s\n",
      "in his Sunday suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went circuitously to Miss Havisham’s by all the back ways, and rang\n",
      "at the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my\n",
      "gloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when\n",
      "she saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned\n",
      "from brown to green and yellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You?” said she. “You? Good gracious! What do you want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to London, Miss Pocket,” said I, “and want to say good-bye\n",
      "to Miss Havisham.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went\n",
      "to ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned\n",
      "and took me up, staring at me all the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread\n",
      "table, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore,\n",
      "and at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then\n",
      "just abreast of the rotted bride-cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t go, Sarah,” she said. “Well, Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,” I was exceedingly\n",
      "careful what I said, “and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking\n",
      "leave of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a gay figure, Pip,” said she, making her crutch stick play\n",
      "round me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were\n",
      "bestowing the finishing gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss\n",
      "Havisham,” I murmured. “And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, ay!” said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with\n",
      "delight. “I have seen Mr. Jaggers. _I_ have heard about it, Pip. So you\n",
      "go to-morrow?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, Miss Havisham.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her\n",
      "enjoyment of Sarah Pocket’s jealous dismay. “Well!” she went on; “you\n",
      "have a promising career before you. Be good—deserve it—and abide by Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers’s instructions.” She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and\n",
      "Sarah’s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Good-bye, Pip!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to my\n",
      "lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came\n",
      "naturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket\n",
      "with triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with\n",
      "both her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly\n",
      "lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen\n",
      "out. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree\n",
      "confounded. I said “Good-bye, Miss Pocket;” but she merely stared, and\n",
      "did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the\n",
      "house, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook’s, took off my new\n",
      "clothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,\n",
      "carrying it—to speak the truth—much more at my ease too, though I had\n",
      "the bundle to carry.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run\n",
      "out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more\n",
      "steadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled\n",
      "away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more\n",
      "appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I\n",
      "dressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my\n",
      "splendour\t until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion,\n",
      "graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish\n",
      "with. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in\n",
      "spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little\n",
      "hand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all\n",
      "alone. I am afraid—sore afraid—that this purpose originated in my sense\n",
      "of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the\n",
      "coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of\n",
      "this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on\n",
      "this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had\n",
      "an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in\n",
      "the morning. I did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places\n",
      "instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now\n",
      "pigs, now men,—never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me\n",
      "until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and\n",
      "partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in\n",
      "taking it fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not\n",
      "sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when\n",
      "I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the\n",
      "afternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking\n",
      "of the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go\n",
      "downstairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and\n",
      "unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again,\n",
      "until Biddy called to me that I was late.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,\n",
      "saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,\n",
      "“Well! I suppose I must be off!” and then I kissed my sister who was\n",
      "laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy,\n",
      "and threw my arms around Joe’s neck. Then I took up my little\n",
      "portmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I\n",
      "presently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing\n",
      "an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped\n",
      "then, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above\n",
      "his head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put her apron to her\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had\n",
      "supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to\n",
      "have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High\n",
      "Street. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very\n",
      "peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to\n",
      "show me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all\n",
      "beyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave\n",
      "and sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the\n",
      "village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, “Good-bye, O my dear,\n",
      "dear friend!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain\n",
      "upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was\n",
      "better after I had cried than before,—more sorry, more aware of my own\n",
      "ingratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe\n",
      "with me then.\n",
      "\n",
      "So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the\n",
      "course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was\n",
      "clear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would\n",
      "not get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another\n",
      "evening at home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made\n",
      "up my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite\n",
      "practicable to get down and walk back, when we changed again. And while\n",
      "I was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact\n",
      "resemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and my\n",
      "heart would beat high.—As if he could possibly be there!\n",
      "\n",
      "We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to\n",
      "go back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and\n",
      "the world lay spread before me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the end of the first stage of Pip’s expectations.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five\n",
      "hours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by\n",
      "which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about\n",
      "the Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.\n",
      "\n",
      "We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was\n",
      "treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything:\n",
      "otherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I\n",
      "might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly,\n",
      "crooked, narrow, and dirty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and\n",
      "he had written after it on his card, “just out of Smithfield, and close\n",
      "by the coach-office.” Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to\n",
      "have as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed\n",
      "me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier\n",
      "of steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on\n",
      "his box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old\n",
      "weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a\n",
      "work of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets\n",
      "outside, and ragged things behind for I don’t know how many footmen to\n",
      "hold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from\n",
      "yielding to the temptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a\n",
      "straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the\n",
      "horses’ nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman\n",
      "beginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop\n",
      "we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open\n",
      "door, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How much?” I asked the coachman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coachman answered, “A shilling—unless you wish to make it more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it must be a shilling,” observed the coachman. “I don’t want to\n",
      "get into trouble. _I_ know _him_!” He darkly closed an eye at Mr.\n",

      "\n",
      "When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the\n",
      "ascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his\n",
      "mind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my\n",
      "hand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is not,” returned the clerk. “He is in Court at present. Am I\n",
      "addressing Mr. Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn’t say how\n",
      "long he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time\n",
      "being valuable, that he won’t be longer than he can help.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner\n",
      "chamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a\n",
      "velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on\n",
      "being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go and wait outside, Mike,” said the clerk.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk\n",
      "shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,\n",
      "and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers’s room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most\n",
      "dismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head,\n",
      "and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted\n",
      "themselves to peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers\n",
      "about, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd\n",
      "objects about, that I should not have expected to see,—such as an old\n",
      "rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and\n",
      "packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly\n",
      "swollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers’s own high-backed\n",
      "chair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,\n",
      "like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and\n",
      "bit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the\n",
      "clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the\n",
      "wall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers’s chair, being greasy with\n",
      "shoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled\n",
      "forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being\n",
      "turned out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers’s\n",
      "chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I\n",
      "called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to\n",
      "everybody else’s disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many\n",
      "other clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have\n",
      "the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what\n",
      "was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came\n",
      "there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers’s\n",
      "family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such\n",
      "ill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the\n",
      "blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.\n",
      "Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits\n",
      "may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and\n",
      "grit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers’s close room, until I really could not bear the two casts\n",
      "on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers’s chair, and got up and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I\n",
      "waited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into\n",
      "Smithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being\n",
      "all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to\n",
      "me. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a\n",
      "street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul’s bulging at me\n",
      "from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate\n",
      "Prison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered\n",
      "with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and\n",
      "from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits\n",
      "and beer, I inferred that the trials were on.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk\n",
      "minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a\n",
      "trial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half\n",
      "a crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice\n",
      "in his wig and robes,—mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and\n",
      "presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I\n",
      "declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as\n",
      "to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also\n",
      "where people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors’\n",
      "Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest\n",
      "of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that “four on ’em”\n",
      "would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the\n",
      "morning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a\n",
      "sickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice’s\n",
      "proprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his\n",
      "pocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently not\n",
      "belonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had\n",
      "bought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought\n",
      "myself well rid of him for a shilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I\n",
      "found he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour\n",
      "of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became\n",
      "aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as\n",
      "I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew\n",
      "Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the\n",
      "pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when\n",
      "they first passed me, that “Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.”\n",
      "There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and\n",
      "one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted\n",
      "her by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, “Jaggers\n",
      "is for him, ’Melia, and what more _could_ you have?” There was a\n",
      "red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering\n",
      "there, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand;\n",
      "and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a\n",
      "highly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a\n",
      "lamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the\n",
      "words, “O Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth,\n",
      "give me Jaggerth!” These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian\n",
      "made a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than\n",
      "ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close\n",
      "into Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards\n",
      "me. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there\n",
      "was quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and\n",
      "walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed\n",
      "himself to his followers.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, he took the two secret men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I have nothing to say to _you_,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\n",
      "finger at them. “I want to know no more than I know. As to the result,\n",
      "it’s a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you\n",
      "paid Wemmick?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We made the money up this morning, sir,” said one of the men,\n",
      "submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers’s face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it\n",
      "up at all. Has Wemmick got it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” said both the men together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well; then you may go. Now, I won’t have it!” said Mr Jaggers,\n",
      "waving his hand at them to put them behind him. “If you say a word to\n",
      "me, I’ll throw up the case.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We thought, Mr. Jaggers—” one of the men began, pulling off his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s what I told you not to do,” said Mr. Jaggers. “_You_ thought! I\n",
      "think for you; that’s enough for you. If I want you, I know where to\n",
      "find you; I don’t want you to find me. Now I won’t have it. I won’t\n",
      "hear a word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind\n",
      "again, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now _you_!” said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on\n",
      "the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly\n",
      "separated,—“Oh! Amelia, is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Mr. Jaggers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And do you remember,” retorted Mr. Jaggers, “that but for me you\n",
      "wouldn’t be here and couldn’t be here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O yes, sir!” exclaimed both women together. “Lord bless you, sir, well\n",
      "we knows that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then why,” said Mr. Jaggers, “do you come here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Bill, sir!” the crying woman pleaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I tell you what!” said Mr. Jaggers. “Once for all. If you don’t\n",
      "know that your Bill’s in good hands, I know it. And if you come here\n",
      "bothering about your Bill, I’ll make an example of both your Bill and\n",
      "you, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O yes, sir! Every farden.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another\n",
      "word—one single word—and Wemmick shall give you your money back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately. No\n",
      "one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the\n",
      "skirts of Mr. Jaggers’s coat to his lips several times.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know this man!” said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating\n",
      "strain: “What does this fellow want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who’s he?” said Mr. Jaggers. “Let go of my coat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing\n",
      "it, replied, “Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re too late,” said Mr. Jaggers. “I am over the way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!” cried my excitable acquaintance,\n",
      "turning white, “don’t thay you’re again Habraham Latharuth!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and there’s an end of it. Get out of the\n",
      "way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen’th gone to Mithter\n",
      "Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter\n",
      "Jaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you’d have the condethenthun\n",
      "to be bought off from the t’other thide—at hany thuperior prithe!—money\n",
      "no object!—Mithter Jaggerth—Mithter—!”\n",
      "\n",
      "My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and\n",
      "left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further\n",
      "interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and\n",
      "the man in velveteen with the fur cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here’s Mike,” said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and\n",
      "approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of\n",
      "hair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling\n",
      "at the bell-rope; “your man comes on this afternoon. Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a\n",
      "constitutional cold; “arter a deal o’ trouble, I’ve found one, sir, as\n",
      "might do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is he prepared to swear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this\n",
      "time; “in a general way, anythink.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. “Now, I warned you before,”\n",
      "said he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, “that if you\n",
      "ever presumed to talk in that way here, I’d make an example of you. You\n",
      "infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious\n",
      "what he had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Spooney!” said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his\n",
      "elbow. “Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,” said my guardian, very sternly,\n",
      "“once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is\n",
      "prepared to swear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson\n",
      "from his face, and slowly replied, “Ayther to character, or to having\n",
      "been in his company and never left him all the night in question.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the\n",
      "ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before\n",
      "beginning to reply in a nervous manner, “We’ve dressed him up like—”\n",
      "when my guardian blustered out,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What? You WILL, will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "(“Spooney!” added the clerk again, with another stir.)\n",
      "\n",
      "After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is dressed like a ’spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he here?” asked my guardian.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I left him,” said Mike, “a setting on some doorsteps round the\n",
      "corner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take him past that window, and let me see him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The window indicated was the office window. We all three went to it,\n",
      "behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an\n",
      "accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short\n",
      "suit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was\n",
      "not by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of\n",
      "recovery, which was painted over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell him to take his witness away directly,” said my guardian to the\n",
      "clerk, in extreme disgust, “and ask him what he means by bringing such\n",
      "a fellow as that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,\n",
      "standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed\n",
      "to bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements\n",
      "he had made for me. I was to go to “Barnard’s Inn,” to young Mr.\n",
      "Pocket’s rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I\n",
      "was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go\n",
      "with him to his father’s house on a visit, that I might try how I liked\n",
      "it. Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,—it was a very liberal\n",
      "one,—and had handed to me from one of my guardian’s drawers, the cards\n",
      "of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,\n",
      "and such other things as I could in reason want. “You will find your\n",
      "credit good, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt\n",
      "like a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, “but I shall by\n",
      "this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find\n",
      "you outrunning the constable. Of course you’ll go wrong somehow, but\n",
      "that’s no fault of mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth\n",
      "while, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me,\n",
      "if I pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk\n",
      "was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I\n",
      "accompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.\n",
      "We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way\n",
      "among them by saying coolly yet decisively, “I tell you it’s no use; he\n",
      "won’t have a word to say to one of you;” and we soon got clear of them,\n",
      "and went on side by side.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chapter XXI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was\n",
      "like in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in\n",
      "stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have\n",
      "been imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some\n",
      "marks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been\n",
      "softer and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.\n",
      "The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment\n",
      "over his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them\n",
      "off. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his\n",
      "linen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for\n",
      "he wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a\n",
      "lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,\n",
      "that several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were\n",
      "quite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering\n",
      "eyes,—small, keen, and black,—and thin wide mottled lips. He had had\n",
      "them, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you were never in London before?” said Mr. Wemmick to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ was new here once,” said Mr. Wemmick. “Rum to think of now!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are well acquainted with it now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, yes,” said Mr. Wemmick. “I know the moves of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it a very wicked place?” I asked, more for the sake of saying\n",
      "something than for information.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are\n",
      "plenty of people anywhere, who’ll do that for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there is bad blood between you and them,” said I, to soften it off\n",
      "a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O! I don’t know about bad blood,” returned Mr. Wemmick; “there’s not\n",
      "much bad blood about. They’ll do it, if there’s anything to be got by\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That makes it worse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think so?” returned Mr. Wemmick. “Much about the same, I should\n",
      "say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before\n",
      "him: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the\n",
      "streets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a\n",
      "mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the\n",
      "top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical\n",
      "appearance, and that he was not smiling at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?” I asked Mr. Wemmick.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said he, nodding in the direction. “At Hammersmith, west of\n",
      "London.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that far?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! Say five miles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, you’re a regular cross-examiner!” said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me\n",
      "with an approving air. “Yes, I know him. _I_ know him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of\n",
      "these words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways\n",
      "at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,\n",
      "when he said here we were at Barnard’s Inn. My depression was not\n",
      "alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment\n",
      "to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town\n",
      "was a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a\n",
      "disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection\n",
      "of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club\n",
      "for Tom-cats.\n",
      "\n",
      "We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an\n",
      "introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me\n",
      "like a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in\n",
      "it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the\n",
      "most dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever\n",
      "seen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those\n",
      "houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and\n",
      "curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable\n",
      "makeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,\n",
      "as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of\n",
      "Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the\n",
      "present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy\n",
      "mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,\n",
      "and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and\n",
      "humiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry\n",
      "rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and\n",
      "cellar,—rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand\n",
      "besides—addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,\n",
      "“Try Barnard’s Mixture.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great\n",
      "expectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. “Ah!” said he,\n",
      "mistaking me; “the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,—which\n",
      "appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of\n",
      "those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find\n",
      "themselves without the means of coming down,—to a set of chambers on\n",
      "the top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was\n",
      "a label on the letter-box, “Return shortly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He hardly thought you’d come so soon,” Mr. Wemmick explained. “You\n",
      "don’t want me any more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, thank you,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I keep the cash,” Mr. Wemmick observed, “we shall most likely meet\n",
      "pretty often. Good day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he\n",
      "thought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting\n",
      "himself,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure! Yes. You’re in the habit of shaking hands?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,\n",
      "but said yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have got so out of it!” said Mr. Wemmick,—“except at last. Very\n",
      "glad, I’m sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window\n",
      "and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it\n",
      "came down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not\n",
      "put my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view\n",
      "of the Inn through the window’s encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully\n",
      "looking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pocket, Junior’s, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly\n",
      "maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my\n",
      "name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the\n",
      "window, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose\n",
      "before me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a\n",
      "member of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under\n",
      "each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of\n",
      "breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Pip?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Pocket?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear me!” he exclaimed. “I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a\n",
      "coach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would\n",
      "come by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,—not\n",
      "that that is any excuse,—for I thought, coming from the country, you\n",
      "might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden\n",
      "Market to get it good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my\n",
      "head. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think\n",
      "this was a dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear me!” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “This door sticks so!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while\n",
      "the paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold\n",
      "them. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with\n",
      "the door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,\n",
      "that he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite\n",
      "door, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start\n",
      "out of my head, and as if this must be a dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray come in,” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “Allow me to lead the way. I\n",
      "am rather bare here, but I hope you’ll be able to make out tolerably\n",
      "well till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably\n",
      "through to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk\n",
      "about London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As\n",
      "to our table, you won’t find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied\n",
      "from our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your\n",
      "expense, such being Mr. Jaggers’s directions. As to our lodging, it’s\n",
      "not by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my\n",
      "father hasn’t anything to give me, and I shouldn’t be willing to take\n",
      "it, if he had. This is our sitting-room,—just such chairs and tables\n",
      "and carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You\n",
      "mustn’t give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,\n",
      "because they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little\n",
      "bedroom; rather musty, but Barnard’s _is_ musty. This is your bedroom;\n",
      "the furniture’s hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the\n",
      "purpose; if you should want anything, I’ll go and fetch it. The\n",
      "chambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan’t\n",
      "fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you’re holding the\n",
      "fruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite\n",
      "ashamed.”\n",
      "\n",

      "contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. “Well!” said the\n",
      "pale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humouredly, “it’s all\n",

      "He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his\n",
      "attention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.\n",

      "there, that day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst\n",
      "out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn’t ask\n",

      "This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with\n",

      "in Miss Havisham’s house on the very day of our combat, but never at\n",
      "any other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having\n",

      "\n",
      "“He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he\n",

      "from his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham’s\n",
      "cousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he\n",

      "\n",
      "Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.\n",
      "I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who\n",
      "more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural\n",
      "incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something\n",
      "wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the\n",
      "same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I\n",
      "don’t know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first\n",
      "occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what\n",
      "means.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered\n",
      "languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did\n",
      "not seem indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face,\n",
      "but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.\n",
      "His figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had\n",
      "taken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be\n",
      "light and young. Whether Mr. Trabb’s local work would have sat more\n",
      "gracefully on him than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious\n",
      "that he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carried\n",
      "off my new suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a\n",
      "bad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,\n",
      "and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.\n",
      "I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a\n",
      "country place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would\n",
      "take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever\n",
      "he saw me at a loss or going wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With pleasure,” said he, “though I venture to prophesy that you’ll\n",
      "want very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I\n",
      "should like to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me\n",
      "the favour to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my\n",
      "Christian name was Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t take to Philip,” said he, smiling, “for it sounds like a moral\n",
      "boy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,\n",
      "or so fat that he couldn’t see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that\n",
      "he locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a\n",
      "bird’s-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in\n",
      "the neighbourhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious,\n",
      "and you have been a blacksmith,—would you mind it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shouldn’t mind anything that you propose,” I answered, “but I don’t\n",
      "understand you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There’s a charming piece of\n",
      "music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like it very much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, my dear Handel,” said he, turning round as the door opened,\n",
      "“here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the\n",
      "table, because the dinner is of your providing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a\n",
      "nice little dinner,—seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor’s Feast,—and it\n",
      "acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent\n",
      "circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.\n",
      "This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the\n",
      "banquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have\n",
      "said, the lap of luxury,—being entirely furnished forth from the\n",
      "coffee-house,—the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a\n",
      "comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter\n",
      "the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell\n",
      "over them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the\n",
      "bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into\n",
      "my bed in the next room,—where I found much of its parsley and butter\n",
      "in a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made\n",
      "the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my\n",
      "pleasure was without alloy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his\n",
      "promise to tell me about Miss Havisham.\n",
      "\n",
      "“True,” he replied. “I’ll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the\n",
      "topic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put\n",
      "the knife in the mouth,—for fear of accidents,—and that while the fork\n",
      "is reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It\n",
      "is scarcely worth mentioning, only it’s as well to do as other people\n",
      "do. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This\n",
      "has two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is\n",
      "the object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening\n",
      "oysters, on the part of the right elbow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we\n",
      "both laughed and I scarcely blushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” he pursued, “concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must\n",
      "know, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her\n",
      "father denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in\n",
      "your part of the world, and was a brewer. I don’t know why it should be\n",
      "a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you\n",
      "cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was\n",
      "and brew. You see it every day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not on any account,” returned Herbert; “but a public-house may keep a\n",
      "gentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his\n",
      "daughter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Havisham was an only child?” I hazarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child; she\n",
      "had a half-brother. Her father privately married again—his cook, I\n",
      "rather think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought he was proud,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,\n",
      "because he was proud, and in course of time _she_ died. When she was\n",
      "dead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then\n",
      "the son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are\n",
      "acquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,\n",
      "extravagant, undutiful,—altogether bad. At last his father disinherited\n",
      "him; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though\n",
      "not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.—Take another glass of wine,\n",
      "and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to\n",
      "be so strictly conscientious in emptying one’s glass, as to turn it\n",
      "bottom upwards with the rim on one’s nose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I\n",
      "thanked him, and apologised. He said, “Not at all,” and resumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after\n",
      "as a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what\n",
      "with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.\n",
      "There were stronger differences between him and her than there had been\n",
      "between him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a\n",
      "deep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father’s\n",
      "anger. Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,—merely breaking off,\n",
      "my dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a\n",
      "tumbler.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to\n",
      "say. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a\n",
      "much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it\n",
      "within those limits. Again I thanked him and apologised, and again he\n",
      "said in the cheerfullest manner, “Not at all, I am sure!” and resumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There appeared upon the scene—say at the races, or the public balls,\n",
      "or anywhere else you like—a certain man, who made love to Miss\n",
      "Havisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,\n",
      "before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that\n",
      "he was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he\n",
      "was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a\n",
      "gentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a\n",
      "principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever\n",
      "was, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no\n",
      "varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you\n",
      "put on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued\n",
      "Miss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe\n",
      "she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the\n",
      "susceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and she\n",
      "passionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized\n",
      "him. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got\n",
      "great sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out\n",
      "of a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his\n",
      "father) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband\n",
      "he must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in\n",
      "Miss Havisham’s counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in love\n",
      "to be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, with\n",
      "the exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or\n",
      "jealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that she\n",
      "was doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too\n",
      "unreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrily\n",
      "ordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has\n",
      "never seen her since.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought of her having said, “Matthew will come and see me at last\n",
      "when I am laid dead upon that table;” and I asked Herbert whether his\n",
      "father was so inveterate against her?\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not that,” said he, “but she charged him, in the presence of her\n",
      "intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon\n",
      "her for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would\n",
      "look true—even to him—and even to her. To return to the man and make an\n",
      "end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were\n",
      "bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were\n",
      "invited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which she received,” I struck in, “when she was dressing for her\n",
      "marriage? At twenty minutes to nine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the hour and minute,” said Herbert, nodding, “at which she\n",
      "afterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it\n",
      "most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can’t tell you, because I\n",
      "don’t know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she\n",
      "laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never\n",
      "since looked upon the light of day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all the story?” I asked, after considering it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it\n",
      "out for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss\n",
      "Havisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was\n",
      "absolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one\n",
      "thing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced\n",
      "confidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it\n",
      "was a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder he didn’t marry her and get all the property,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have\n",
      "been a part of her half-brother’s scheme,” said Herbert. “Mind! I don’t\n",
      "know that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What became of the two men?” I asked, after again considering the\n",

      "blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then.\n",
      "It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest\n",

      "were incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging\n",
      "from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday\n",

      "eyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard,\n",
      "of a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into another\n",
      "back second floor, rather than a look out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon ’Change, and I saw\n",

      "be great merchants, though I couldn’t understand why they should all be\n",
      "out of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a\n",
      "celebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have\n",
      "been the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help\n",
      "noticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths\n",
      "and knives and waiters’ clothes, than in the steaks. This collation\n",
      "disposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease, which was not\n",
      "charged for), we went back to Barnard’s Inn and got my little\n",
      "portmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at\n",
      "two or three o’clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk\n",
      "to Mr. Pocket’s house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct\n",
      "into a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket’s children\n",
      "were playing about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my\n",
      "interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr.\n",
      "and Mrs. Pocket’s children were not growing up or being brought up, but\n",
      "were tumbling up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with\n",
      "her legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket’s two nurse-maids\n",
      "were looking about them while the children played. “Mamma,” said\n",
      "Herbert, “this is young Mr. Pip.” Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me\n",
      "with an appearance of amiable dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Master Alick and Miss Jane,” cried one of the nurses to two of the\n",
      "children, “if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you’ll fall over\n",
      "into the river and be drownded, and what’ll your pa say then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket’s handkerchief, and\n",
      "said, “If that don’t make six times you’ve dropped it, Mum!” Upon which\n",
      "Mrs. Pocket laughed and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and settling\n",
      "herself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance\n",
      "immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been\n",
      "reading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines,\n",
      "she fixed her eyes upon me, and said, “I hope your mamma is quite\n",
      "well?” This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I\n",
      "began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such\n",
      "person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have\n",
      "been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the\n",
      "nurse came to my rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, “if that don’t\n",
      "make seven times! What ARE you a-doing of this afternoon, Mum!” Mrs.\n",
      "Pocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable\n",
      "surprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of\n",
      "recognition, and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and forgot me, and went on\n",
      "reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than\n",
      "six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had\n",
      "scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the\n",
      "region of air, wailing dolefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there ain’t Baby!” said Flopson, appearing to think it most\n",
      "surprising. “Make haste up, Millers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by\n",
      "degrees the child’s wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a\n",
      "young ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all\n",
      "the time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any\n",
      "rate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the\n",
      "remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed\n",
      "near Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and\n",
      "tumbled over her,—always very much to her momentary astonishment, and\n",
      "their own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for\n",
      "this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to\n",
      "speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,\n",
      "which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.\n",
      "Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby\n",
      "and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gracious me, Flopson!” said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a\n",
      "moment, “everybody’s tumbling!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gracious you, indeed, Mum!” returned Flopson, very red in the face;\n",
      "“what have you got there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ got here, Flopson?” asked Mrs. Pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, if it ain’t your footstool!” cried Flopson. “And if you keep it\n",
      "under your skirts like that, who’s to help tumbling? Here! Take the\n",
      "baby, Mum, and give me your book.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a\n",
      "little in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had\n",
      "lasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders\n",
      "that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made\n",
      "the second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the\n",
      "little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the\n",
      "children into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket\n",
      "came out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to\n",
      "find that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression\n",

      "alarming personage.” He was a young-looking man, in spite of his\n",
      "perplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner seemed quite\n",
      "natural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;\n",
      "there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would\n",
      "have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was\n",
      "very near being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to\n",
      "Mrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which\n",
      "were black and handsome, “Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?”\n",
      "And she looked up from her book, and said, “Yes.” She then smiled upon\n",

      "I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.\n",
      "Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased\n",
      "Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased\n",
      "father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody’s determined\n",
      "opposition arising out of entirely personal motives,—I forget whose, if\n",
      "I ever knew,—the Sovereign’s, the Prime Minister’s, the Lord\n",

      "himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite\n",

      "address engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first\n",
      "stone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage\n",
      "either the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed\n",
      "Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature\n",
      "of things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the\n",
      "acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady\n",
      "by this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but\n",
      "perfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,\n",
      "in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was\n",
      "also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to\n",
      "mount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing\n",
      "the one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket\n",
      "had taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it\n",
      "would seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the\n",
      "knowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing\n",
      "to bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that\n",
      "dower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket\n",
      "that his wife was “a treasure for a Prince.” Mr. Pocket had invested\n",
      "the Prince’s treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was\n",
      "supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs.\n",
      "Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,\n",

      "\n",
      "“And she is of so aristocratic a disposition—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am,” I said again, with the same object as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—That it _is_ hard,” said Mrs. Coiler, “to have dear Mr. Pocket’s time\n",
      "and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher’s time\n",
      "and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,\n",
      "and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company\n",
      "manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and\n",
      "Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and\n",
      "other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian\n",
      "name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It\n",
      "further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the\n",
      "garden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which\n",
      "her grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at\n",
      "all. Drummle didn’t say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a\n",
      "sulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs.\n",
      "Pocket as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler\n",
      "the toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the\n",
      "conversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but\n",
      "it promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the\n",
      "announcement of a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook\n",
      "had mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first\n",
      "time, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance\n",
      "that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on\n",
      "anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He\n",
      "laid down the carving-knife and fork,—being engaged in carving, at the\n",
      "moment,—put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make\n",
      "an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done\n",
      "this, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with\n",
      "what he was about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked\n",
      "it for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the\n",
      "pleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at me\n",
      "when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and\n",
      "localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and\n",
      "when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little\n",
      "to her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for\n",
      "being on the opposite side of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made\n",
      "admiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,—a sagacious way of\n",
      "improving their minds. There were four little girls, and two little\n",
      "boys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby’s next\n",
      "successor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and\n",
      "Millers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been\n",
      "recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs.\n",
      "Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she\n",
      "rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but\n",
      "didn’t quite know what to make of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,” said Flopson. “Don’t\n",
      "take it that way, or you’ll get its head under the table.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon\n",
      "the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious\n",
      "concussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,” said Flopson; “and Miss Jane, come\n",
      "and dance to baby, do!”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely\n",
      "taken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place\n",
      "by me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and\n",
      "laughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the\n",
      "meantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,\n",
      "and we all laughed and were glad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,\n",
      "then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket’s lap, and gave it the nut-crackers\n",
      "to play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice\n",
      "that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its\n",
      "eyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the\n",
      "two nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase\n",
      "with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly\n",
      "lost half his buttons at the gaming-table.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket’s falling into a\n",
      "discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a\n",
      "sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the\n",
      "baby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers.\n",
      "At length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled,\n",
      "softly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the\n",
      "dangerous weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the\n",
      "same time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mamma dear,” lisped the little girl, “baby ood have put hith eyeth\n",
      "out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dare you tell me so?” retorted Mrs. Pocket. “Go and sit down in\n",
      "your chair this moment!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Pocket’s dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if\n",
      "I myself had done something to rouse it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Belinda,” remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,\n",
      "“how can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the\n",
      "protection of baby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will not allow anybody to interfere,” said Mrs. Pocket. “I am\n",
      "surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of\n",
      "interference.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God!” cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.\n",
      "“Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to\n",
      "save them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will not be interfered with by Jane,” said Mrs. Pocket, with a\n",
      "majestic glance at that innocent little offender. “I hope I know my\n",
      "poor grandpapa’s position. Jane, indeed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did\n",
      "lift himself some inches out of his chair. “Hear this!” he helplessly\n",
      "exclaimed to the elements. “Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for\n",
      "people’s poor grandpapa’s positions!” Then he let himself down again,\n",
      "and became silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A\n",
      "pause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a\n",
      "series of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the\n",
      "only member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had\n",
      "any decided acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Drummle,” said Mrs. Pocket, “will you ring for Flopson? Jane, you\n",
      "undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with\n",
      "ma!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The baby was the soul of honour, and protested with all its might. It\n",
      "doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket’s arm, exhibited a\n",
      "pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its\n",
      "soft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it\n",
      "gained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a\n",
      "few minutes, being nursed by little Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened that the other five children were left behind at the\n",
      "dinner-table, through Flopson’s having some private engagement, and\n",
      "their not being anybody else’s business. I thus became aware of the\n",
      "mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in\n",
      "the following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his\n",
      "face heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes,\n",
      "as if he couldn’t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in\n",
      "that establishment, and why they hadn’t been billeted by Nature on\n",
      "somebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain\n",
      "questions,—as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,\n",
      "Flopson was going to mend it when she had time,—and how little Fanny\n",
      "came by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it\n",
      "when she didn’t forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and\n",
      "gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as\n",
      "they went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the\n",
      "hair he dismissed the hopeless subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop\n",
      "had each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I\n",
      "was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but\n",
      "as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,—not to\n",
      "say for other waters,—I at once engaged to place myself under the\n",
      "tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to\n",
      "whom I was introduced by my new allies. This practical authority\n",
      "confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he\n",
      "could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt\n",
      "if he would have paid it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we\n",
      "should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable\n",
      "domestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid\n",
      "came in, and said, “If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak to your master?” said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused\n",
      "again. “How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or\n",
      "speak to me—at some other time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Begging your pardon, ma’am,” returned the housemaid, “I should wish to\n",
      "speak at once, and to speak to master.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of\n",
      "ourselves until he came back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a pretty thing, Belinda!” said Mr. Pocket, returning with a\n",
      "countenance expressive of grief and despair. “Here’s the cook lying\n",
      "insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh\n",
      "butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, “This is\n",
      "that odious Sophia’s doing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean, Belinda?” demanded Mr. Pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sophia has told you,” said Mrs. Pocket. “Did I not see her with my own\n",
      "eyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask\n",
      "to speak to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But has she not taken me downstairs, Belinda,” returned Mr. Pocket,\n",
      "“and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And do you defend her, Matthew,” said Mrs. Pocket, “for making\n",
      "mischief?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Am I, grandpapa’s granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?” said\n",
      "Mrs. Pocket. “Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful\n",
      "woman, and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after\n",
      "the situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the\n",
      "attitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he said, with a\n",
      "hollow voice, “Good night, Mr. Pip,” when I deemed it advisable to go\n",
      "to bed and leave him.\n",

      "After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and\n",
      "had gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had\n",
      "ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk\n",
      "together. He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he\n",
      "referred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed\n",
      "for any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my\n",
      "destiny if I could “hold my own” with the average of young men in\n",
      "prosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to\n",
      "the contrary.\n",
      "\n",
      "He advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition\n",
      "of such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the\n",
      "functions of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that\n",
      "with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me,\n",
      "and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his\n",
      "way of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself\n",
      "on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state\n",
      "at once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his\n",
      "compact with me, that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling\n",
      "mine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no\n",
      "doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no\n",
      "such excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever\n",
      "regard him as having anything ludicrous about him—or anything but what\n",
      "was serious, honest, and good—in his tutor communication with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had\n",
      "begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my\n",
      "bedroom in Barnard’s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my\n",
      "manners would be none the worse for Herbert’s society. Mr. Pocket did\n",
      "not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could\n",
      "possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt\n",
      "that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would\n",
      "save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted\n",
      "my wish to Mr. Jaggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,” said I, “and one or\n",
      "two other little things, I should be quite at home there.”\n",

      "“Go it!” said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. “I told you you’d get\n",

      "\n",
      "I said I didn’t know how much.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“O, not nearly so much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Five pounds?” said Mr. Jaggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, “O, more than\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“More than that, eh!” retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with\n",
      "his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the\n",
      "wall behind me; “how much more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so difficult to fix a sum,” said I, hesitating.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers. “Let’s get at it. Twice five; will that do?\n",
      "Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?”\n",

      "I said I thought that would do handsomely.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Twenty pounds, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wemmick!” said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. “Take Mr. Pip’s\n",
      "written order, and pay him twenty pounds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked\n",
      "impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never\n",
      "laughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising\n",
      "himself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows\n",
      "joined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to\n",
      "creak, as if _they_ laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened\n",
      "to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to\n",
      "Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers’s manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell him that, and he’ll take it as a compliment,” answered Wemmick;\n",
      "“he don’t mean that you _should_ know what to make of it.—Oh!” for I\n",
      "looked surprised, “it’s not personal; it’s professional: only\n",
      "professional.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wemmick was at his desk, lunching—and crunching—on a dry hard biscuit;\n",
      "pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as\n",
      "if he were posting them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Always seems to me,” said Wemmick, “as if he had set a man-trap and\n",
      "was watching it. Suddenly—click—you’re caught!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life,\n",
      "I said I supposed he was very skilful?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Deep,” said Wemmick, “as Australia.” Pointing with his pen at the\n",
      "office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the\n",
      "purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the\n",
      "globe. “If there was anything deeper,” added Wemmick, bringing his pen\n",
      "to paper, “he’d be it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,\n",
      "“Ca-pi-tal!” Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he\n",
      "replied,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t run much into clerks, because there’s only one Jaggers, and\n",
      "people won’t have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Would\n",
      "you like to see ’em? You are one of us, as I may say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the\n",
      "post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key of\n",
      "which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his\n",
      "coat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark\n",
      "and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers’s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase\n",
      "for years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something\n",
      "between a publican and a rat-catcher—a large pale, puffed, swollen\n",
      "man—was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby\n",
      "appearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to\n",
      "be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers’s coffers. “Getting evidence\n",
      "together,” said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, “for the Bailey.” In the\n",
      "room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair\n",
      "(his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was\n",
      "similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented\n",
      "to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt\n",
      "me anything I pleased,—and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,\n",
      "as if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a\n",
      "high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was\n",
      "dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been\n",
      "waxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of\n",
      "the other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers’s own use.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick\n",
      "led me into my guardian’s room, and said, “This you’ve seen already.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray,” said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them\n",
      "caught my sight again, “whose likenesses are those?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“These?” said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off\n",
      "the horrible heads before bringing them down. “These are two celebrated\n",
      "ones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap\n",
      "(why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the\n",
      "inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered\n",
      "his master, and, considering that he wasn’t brought up to evidence,\n",
      "didn’t plan it badly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it like him?” I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat\n",
      "upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Like him? It’s himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,\n",
      "directly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me,\n",
      "hadn’t you, Old Artful?” said Wemmick. He then explained this\n",
      "affectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady\n",
      "and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,\n",
      "“Had it made for me, express!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is the lady anybody?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” returned Wemmick. “Only his game. (You liked your bit of game,\n",
      "didn’t you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except\n",
      "one,—and she wasn’t of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn’t\n",
      "have caught _her_ looking after this urn, unless there was something to\n",
      "drink in it.” Wemmick’s attention being thus directed to his brooch, he\n",
      "put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his\n",
      "pocket-handkerchief.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did that other creature come to the same end?” I asked. “He has the\n",
      "same look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re right,” said Wemmick; “it’s the genuine look. Much as if one\n",
      "nostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes, he\n",
      "came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He\n",
      "forged wills, this blade did, if he didn’t also put the supposed\n",
      "testators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though” (Mr.\n",
      "Wemmick was again apostrophising), “and you said you could write Greek.\n",
      "Yah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!”\n",
      "Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the\n",
      "largest of his mourning rings and said, “Sent out to buy it for me,\n",
      "only the day before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,\n",
      "the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived\n",
      "from like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I\n",
      "ventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood\n",
      "before me, dusting his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O yes,” he returned, “these are all gifts of that kind. One brings\n",
      "another, you see; that’s the way of it. I always take ’em. They’re\n",
      "curiosities. And they’re property. They may not be worth much, but,\n",
      "after all, they’re property and portable. It don’t signify to you with\n",
      "your brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,\n",
      "‘Get hold of portable property’.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a\n",
      "friendly manner:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn’t\n",
      "mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I\n",
      "should consider it an honour. I have not much to show you; but such two\n",
      "or three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I\n",
      "am fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thankee,” said he; “then we’ll consider that it’s to come off, when\n",
      "convenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Wemmick, “he’ll give you wine, and good wine. I’ll give\n",
      "you punch, and not bad punch. And now I’ll tell you something. When you\n",
      "go to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall I see something very uncommon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Wemmick, “you’ll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very\n",
      "uncommon, you’ll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original\n",
      "wildness of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won’t lower your\n",
      "opinion of Mr. Jaggers’s powers. Keep your eye on it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his\n",
      "preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I\n",
      "would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers “at it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "For several reasons, and not least because I didn’t clearly know what\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers would be found to be “at,” I replied in the affirmative. We\n",
      "dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where a\n",
      "blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with the\n",
      "fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably\n",
      "chewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or\n",
      "cross-examination,—I don’t know which,—and was striking her, and the\n",
      "bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever\n",
      "degree, said a word that he didn’t approve of, he instantly required to\n",
      "have it “taken down.” If anybody wouldn’t make an admission, he said,\n",
      "“I’ll have it out of you!” and if anybody made an admission, he said,\n",
      "“Now I have got you!” The magistrates shivered under a single bite of\n",
      "his finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his\n",
      "words, and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their\n",
      "direction. Which side he was on I couldn’t make out, for he seemed to\n",
      "me to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I\n",
      "stole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he was\n",
      "making the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive\n",
      "under the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as the\n",
      "representative of British law and justice in that chair that day.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book\n",
      "as if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an\n",
      "acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement, and\n",
      "comprehension,—in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in the\n",
      "large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he\n",
      "himself lolled about in a room,—he was idle, proud, niggardly,\n",
      "reserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,\n",
      "who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the\n",
      "discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley\n",
      "Drummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that\n",
      "gentleman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought\n",
      "to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and\n",
      "admired her beyond measure. He had a woman’s delicacy of feature, and\n",
      "was—“as you may see, though you never saw her,” said Herbert to\n",
      "me—“exactly like his mother.” It was but natural that I should take to\n",
      "him much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest\n",
      "evenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one\n",
      "another, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up in\n",
      "our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He\n",
      "would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious\n",
      "creature, even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and\n",
      "I always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the\n",
      "back-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the\n",
      "moonlight in mid-stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him with a\n",
      "half-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down\n",
      "to Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often\n",
      "took me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all\n",
      "hours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so\n",
      "pleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of\n",
      "untried youth and hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had been in Mr. Pocket’s family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Camilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket’s sister. Georgiana, whom I\n",
      "had seen at Miss Havisham’s on the same occasion, also turned up. She\n",
      "was a cousin,—an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity\n",
      "religion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of\n",
      "cupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon me\n",
      "in my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as a\n",
      "grown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the\n",
      "complacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they held\n",
      "in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily\n",
      "disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon\n",
      "themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied\n",
      "myself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began\n",
      "to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should\n",
      "have thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my\n",
      "books. There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to\n",
      "feel my deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast;\n",
      "and, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I\n",
      "wanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as\n",
      "great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write\n",
      "him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. He\n",
      "replied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect\n",
      "me at the office at six o’clock. Thither I went, and there I found him,\n",
      "putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you think of walking down to Walworth?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” said I, “if you approve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much,” was Wemmick’s reply, “for I have had my legs under the\n",
      "desk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I’ll tell you\n",
      "what I have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,—which\n",
      "is of home preparation,—and a cold roast fowl,—which is from the\n",
      "cook’s-shop. I think it’s tender, because the master of the shop was a\n",
      "Juryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.\n",
      "I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, “Pick us out a\n",
      "good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box\n",
      "another day or two, we could easily have done it.” He said to that,\n",
      "“Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.” I let him, of\n",
      "course. As far as it goes, it’s property and portable. You don’t object\n",
      "to an aged parent, I hope?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,\n",
      "“Because I have got an aged parent at my place.” I then said what\n",
      "politeness required.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, you haven’t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?” he pursued, as we walked\n",
      "along.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect\n",
      "you’ll have an invitation to-morrow. He’s going to ask your pals, too.\n",
      "Three of ’em; ain’t there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my\n",
      "intimate associates, I answered, “Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, he’s going to ask the whole gang,”—I hardly felt complimented by\n",
      "the word,—“and whatever he gives you, he’ll give you good. Don’t look\n",
      "forward to variety, but you’ll have excellence. And there’s another rum\n",
      "thing in his house,” proceeded Wemmick, after a moment’s pause, as if\n",
      "the remark followed on the housekeeper understood; “he never lets a\n",
      "door or window be fastened at night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he never robbed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s it!” returned Wemmick. “He says, and gives it out publicly, “I\n",
      "want to see the man who’ll rob _me_.” Lord bless you, I have heard him,\n",
      "a hundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in\n",
      "our front office, “You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn\n",
      "there; why don’t you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can’t I\n",
      "tempt you?” Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on,\n",
      "for love or money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They dread him so much?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dread him,” said Wemmick. “I believe you they dread him. Not but what\n",
      "he’s artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia\n",
      "metal, every spoon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So they wouldn’t have much,” I observed, “even if they—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! But _he_ would have much,” said Wemmick, cutting me short, “and\n",
      "they know it. He’d have their lives, and the lives of scores of ’em.\n",
      "He’d have all he could get. And it’s impossible to say what he couldn’t\n",
      "get, if he gave his mind to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was falling into meditation on my guardian’s greatness, when Wemmick\n",
      "remarked:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to the absence of plate, that’s only his natural depth, you know. A\n",
      "river’s its natural depth, and he’s his natural depth. Look at his\n",
      "watch-chain. That’s real enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s very massive,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Massive?” repeated Wemmick. “I think so. And his watch is a gold\n",
      "repeater, and worth a hundred pound if it’s worth a penny. Mr. Pip,\n",
      "there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about\n",
      "that watch; there’s not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who\n",
      "wouldn’t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it\n",
      "was red hot, if inveigled into touching it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a\n",
      "more general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the\n",
      "road, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the\n",
      "district of Walworth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little\n",
      "gardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.\n",
      "Wemmick’s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of\n",
      "garden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery\n",
      "mounted with guns.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My own doing,” said Wemmick. “Looks pretty; don’t it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;\n",
      "with the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them\n",
      "sham), and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s a real flagstaff, you see,” said Wemmick, “and on Sundays I run\n",
      "up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I\n",
      "hoist it up—so—and cut off the communication.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and\n",
      "two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he\n",
      "hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and\n",
      "not merely mechanically.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At nine o’clock every night, Greenwich time,” said Wemmick, “the gun\n",
      "fires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you’ll\n",
      "say he’s a Stinger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,\n",
      "constructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an\n",
      "ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, at the back,” said Wemmick, “out of sight, so as not to impede\n",
      "the idea of fortifications,—for it’s a principle with me, if you have\n",
      "an idea, carry it out and keep it up,—I don’t know whether that’s your\n",
      "opinion—”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—At the back, there’s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I\n",
      "knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and\n",
      "you’ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,” said\n",
      "Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, “if\n",
      "you can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of\n",
      "a time in point of provisions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was\n",
      "approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long\n",
      "time to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.\n",
      "Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower\n",
      "was raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which\n",
      "might have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he\n",
      "had constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill\n",
      "going and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent\n",
      "that it made the back of your hand quite wet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my\n",
      "own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,” said Wemmick, in\n",
      "acknowledging my compliments. “Well; it’s a good thing, you know. It\n",
      "brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn’t\n",
      "mind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn’t put\n",
      "you out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There we\n",
      "found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,\n",
      "cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well aged parent,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial\n",
      "and jocose way, “how am you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, John; all right!” replied the old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here’s Mr. Pip, aged parent,” said Wemmick, “and I wish you could hear\n",
      "his name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that’s what he likes. Nod away at\n",
      "him, if you please, like winking!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a fine place of my son’s, sir,” cried the old man, while I\n",
      "nodded as hard as I possibly could. “This is a pretty pleasure-ground,\n",
      "sir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept\n",
      "together by the Nation, after my son’s time, for the people’s\n",
      "enjoyment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re as proud of it as Punch; ain’t you, Aged?” said Wemmick,\n",
      "contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened;\n",
      "“_there’s_ a nod for you;” giving him a tremendous one; “_there’s_\n",
      "another for you;” giving him a still more tremendous one; “you like\n",
      "that, don’t you? If you’re not tired, Mr. Pip—though I know it’s tiring\n",
      "to strangers—will you tip him one more? You can’t think how it pleases\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him\n",
      "bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in\n",
      "the arbour; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had\n",

      "“Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O yes,” said Wemmick, “I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It’s a\n",
      "freehold, by George!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never seen it,” said Wemmick. “Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged.\n",
      "Never heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is\n",
      "another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and\n",
      "when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it’s not\n",
      "in any way disagreeable to you, you’ll oblige me by doing the same. I\n",
      "don’t wish it professionally spoken about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his\n",
      "request. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and\n",
      "talking, until it was almost nine o’clock. “Getting near gun-fire,”\n",
      "said Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; “it’s the Aged’s treat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,\n",
      "with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great\n",
      "nightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the\n",
      "moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and\n",
      "repair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the\n",
      "Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a\n",
      "cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup\n",
      "in it ring. Upon this, the Aged—who I believe would have been blown out\n",
      "of his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows—cried out exultingly,\n",
      "“He’s fired! I heerd him!” and I nodded at the old gentleman until it\n",
      "is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me\n",
      "his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious\n",
      "character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been\n",
      "committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and\n",
      "several manuscript confessions written under condemnation,—upon which\n",
      "Mr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, “every\n",
      "one of ’em Lies, sir.” These were agreeably dispersed among small\n",
      "specimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the\n",
      "proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.\n",
      "They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had\n",
      "been first inducted, and which served, not only as the general\n",
      "sitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan\n",
      "on the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the\n",
      "suspension of a roasting-jack.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged\n",
      "in the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered\n",
      "to give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper\n",
      "was excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot\n",
      "insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have\n",
      "been farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment.\n",
      "Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there\n",
      "being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when\n",
      "I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that\n",
      "pole on my forehead all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him\n",
      "cleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from\n",
      "my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a\n",
      "most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at\n",
      "half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,\n",
      "Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened\n",
      "into a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business\n",
      "and he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as\n",
      "unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the\n",
      "drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged,\n",
      "had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the\n",

      "It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early\n",
      "opportunity of comparing my guardian’s establishment with that of his\n",
      "cashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with\n",
      "his scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he\n",
      "called me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends\n",
      "which Wemmick had prepared me to receive. “No ceremony,” he stipulated,\n",
      "“and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.” I asked him where we should\n",
      "come to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his\n",
      "general objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,\n",
      "“Come here, and I’ll take you home with me.” I embrace this opportunity\n",
      "of remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or\n",
      "a dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,\n",
      "which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer’s shop. It had an\n",
      "unusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would\n",
      "wash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,\n",
      "whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his\n",
      "room. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o’clock next day, he\n",
      "seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than\n",
      "usual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only\n",
      "washing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And\n",
      "even when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,\n",
      "he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before\n",
      "he put his coat on.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into\n",
      "the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was\n",
      "something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his\n",
      "presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along\n",
      "westward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of\n",
      "the streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he\n",
      "never otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody\n",
      "recognised him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side\n",
      "of that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in\n",
      "want of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and\n",
      "opened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and\n",
      "little used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark\n",
      "brown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the\n",
      "panelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know\n",
      "what kind of loops I thought they looked like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his\n",
      "dressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the\n",
      "whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was\n",
      "comfortably laid—no silver in the service, of course—and at the side of\n",
      "his chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and\n",
      "decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed\n",
      "throughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed\n",
      "everything himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,\n",
      "that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,\n",
      "trials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very\n",
      "solid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,\n",
      "and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a\n",
      "little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring\n",
      "the office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an\n",
      "evening and fall to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,—for he and I had\n",
      "walked together,—he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,\n",
      "and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to\n",
      "be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pip,” said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\n",
      "the window, “I don’t know one from the other. Who’s the Spider?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The spider?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s Bentley Drummle,” I replied; “the one with the delicate face is\n",
      "Startop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not making the least account of “the one with the delicate face,” he\n",
      "returned, “Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that\n",
      "fellow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his\n",
      "replying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to\n",
      "screw discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came\n",
      "between me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a woman of about forty, I supposed,—but I may have thought her\n",
      "younger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely\n",
      "pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot\n",
      "say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\n",
      "parted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious\n",
      "expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see\n",
      "Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked\n",
      "to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had\n",
      "seen rise out of the Witches’ caldron.\n",
      "\n",
      "She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\n",
      "finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats\n",
      "at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,\n",
      "while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the\n",
      "housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice\n",
      "mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all\n",
      "the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our\n",
      "host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the\n",
      "table, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean\n",
      "plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just\n",
      "disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant\n",
      "than the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw\n",
      "in her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made\n",
      "a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other\n",
      "natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\n",
      "behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own\n",
      "striking appearance and by Wemmick’s preparation, I observed that\n",
      "whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\n",
      "guardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\n",
      "before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and\n",
      "wanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I\n",
      "fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and\n",
      "a purpose of always holding her in suspense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather\n",
      "than originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of\n",
      "our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing\n",
      "my tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to\n",
      "boast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my\n",
      "lips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the\n",
      "development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\n",
      "way at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our\n",
      "conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied\n",
      "for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.\n",
      "Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to\n",
      "our company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that\n",
      "as to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible\n",
      "agency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity\n",
      "about this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show\n",
      "how muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in\n",
      "a ridiculous manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,\n",
      "taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,\n",
      "was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\n",
      "showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.\n",
      "Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper’s, like a trap,\n",
      "as she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do\n",
      "this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you talk of strength,” said Mr. Jaggers, “_I_’ll show you a wrist.\n",
      "Molly, let them see your wrist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other\n",
      "hand behind her waist. “Master,” she said, in a low voice, with her\n",
      "eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. “Don’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_’ll show you a wrist,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable\n",
      "determination to show it. “Molly, let them see your wrist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Master,” she again murmured. “Please!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Molly,” said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking\n",
      "at the opposite side of the room, “let them see _both_ your wrists.\n",
      "Show them. Come!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She\n",
      "brought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by\n",
      "side. The last wrist was much disfigured,—deeply scarred and scarred\n",
      "across and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us\n",
      "in succession.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s power here,” said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews\n",
      "with his forefinger. “Very few men have the power of wrist that this\n",
      "woman has. It’s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these\n",
      "hands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw\n",
      "stronger in that respect, man’s or woman’s, than these.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued\n",
      "to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment\n",
      "he ceased, she looked at him again. “That’ll do, Molly,” said Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers, giving her a slight nod; “you have been admired, and can go.”\n",
      "She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,\n",
      "putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and\n",
      "passed round the wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At half-past nine, gentlemen,” said he, “we must break up. Pray make\n",
      "the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I\n",
      "drink to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,\n",
      "it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose\n",
      "depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,\n",
      "until he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed\n",
      "to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers’s wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,\n",
      "and I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some\n",
      "boorish sneer of Drummle’s, to the effect that we were too free with\n",
      "our money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that\n",
      "it came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my\n",
      "presence but a week or so before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” retorted Drummle; “he’ll be paid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t mean to imply that he won’t,” said I, “but it might make you\n",
      "hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_You_ should think!” retorted Drummle. “Oh Lord!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare say,” I went on, meaning to be very severe, “that you wouldn’t\n",
      "lend money to any of us if we wanted it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are right,” said Drummle. “I wouldn’t lend one of you a sixpence.\n",
      "I wouldn’t lend anybody a sixpence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_You_ should say,” repeated Drummle. “Oh Lord!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was so very aggravating—the more especially as I found myself\n",
      "making no way against his surly obtuseness—that I said, disregarding\n",
      "Herbert’s efforts to check me,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I’ll tell you what\n",
      "passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ don’t want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,”\n",
      "growled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might\n",
      "both go to the devil and shake ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you, however,” said I, “whether you want to know or not. We\n",
      "said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed\n",
      "to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands\n",
      "in his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that\n",
      "it was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than\n",
      "I had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,\n",
      "being a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact\n",
      "opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct\n",
      "personal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop\n",
      "tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made\n",
      "us all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything,\n",
      "Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his\n",
      "pockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and\n",
      "would have flung it at his adversary’s head, but for our entertainer’s\n",
      "dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that\n",
      "purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and\n",
      "hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, “I am exceedingly\n",
      "sorry to announce that it’s half past nine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,\n",
      "Startop was cheerily calling Drummle “old boy,” as if nothing had\n",
      "happened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not\n",
      "even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,\n",
      "who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;\n",
      "Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the\n",
      "houses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for\n",
      "a moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found\n",
      "him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard\n",
      "at it, washing his hands of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything\n",
      "disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame\n",
      "me much.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pooh!” said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the\n",
      "water-drops; “it’s nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing,\n",

      "him, even though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is\n",

      "I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its\n",
      "appointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings\n",
      "I looked forward to Joe’s coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; with\n",
      "considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of\n",
      "incongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly\n",
      "would have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming\n",
      "to Barnard’s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall\n",
      "in Bentley Drummle’s way. I had little objection to his being seen by\n",
      "Herbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the\n",
      "sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in\n",
      "contempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are\n",
      "usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite\n",
      "unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those\n",
      "wrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were vastly\n",
      "different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honour of\n",
      "occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouring\n",
      "upholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a\n",
      "boy in boots,—top boots,—in bondage and slavery to whom I might have\n",
      "been said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of\n",
      "the refuse of my washerwoman’s family), and had clothed him with a blue\n",
      "coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots\n",
      "already mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to\n",
      "eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my\n",
      "existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday\n",
      "morning in the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged for\n",
      "floorcloth,) and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he\n",
      "thought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being\n",
      "so interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of\n",
      "suspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see _him_, he\n",
      "wouldn’t have been quite so brisk about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and\n",
      "I got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and\n",
      "breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately\n",
      "the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact\n",
      "that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some\n",
      "weak giant of a Sweep.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger\n",
      "pursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on the\n",
      "staircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming\n",
      "upstairs,—his state boots being always too big for him,—and by the time\n",
      "it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his\n",
      "ascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear his\n",
      "finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards\n",
      "distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a\n",
      "faint single rap, and Pepper—such was the compromising name of the\n",
      "avenging boy—announced “Mr. Gargery!” I thought he never would have\n",
      "done wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the\n",

      "\n",
      "With his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put down\n",
      "on the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them\n",
      "straight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird’s-nest\n",
      "with eggs in it, wouldn’t hear of parting with that piece of property,\n",
      "and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which you have that growed,” said Joe, “and that swelled, and that\n",
      "gentle-folked;” Joe considered a little before he discovered this word;\n",

      "“And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.”\n",
      "\n",

      "worse than she were. And Biddy, she’s ever right and ready. And all\n",
      "friends is no backerder, if not no forarder. ’Ceptin Wopsle; he’s had a\n",

      "\n",
      "All this time (still with both hands taking great care of the\n",

      "round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Had a drop, Joe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why yes,” said Joe, lowering his voice, “he’s left the Church and went\n",
      "into the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him to\n",
      "London along with me. And his wish were,” said Joe, getting the\n",
      "bird’s-nest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an\n",
      "egg with his right; “if no offence, as I would ’and you that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of a\n",
      "small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that\n",
      "very week, of “the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,\n",
      "whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National\n",
      "Bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic\n",

      "\n",
      "“Were you at his performance, Joe?” I inquired.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Was there a great sensation?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why,” said Joe, “yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.\n",
      "Partickler when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,\n",
      "whether it were calc’lated to keep a man up to his work with a good\n",
      "hart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with\n",
      "“Amen!” A man may have had a misfortun’ and been in the Church,” said\n",
      "Joe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, “but that\n",
      "is no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which I\n",
      "meantersay, if the ghost of a man’s own father cannot be allowed to\n",
      "claim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning ’at\n",
      "is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers\n",
      "brings it off, try to keep it on how you may.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A ghost-seeing effect in Joe’s own countenance informed me that Herbert\n",
      "had entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his\n",
      "hand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird’s-nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your servant, Sir,” said Joe, “which I hope as you and Pip”—here his\n",
      "eye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so\n",
      "plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the\n",
      "family, that I frowned it down and confused him more—“I meantersay, you\n",
      "two gentlemen,—which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?\n",
      "For the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,”\n",
      "said Joe, confidentially, “and I believe its character do stand it; but\n",
      "I wouldn’t keep a pig in it myself,—not in the case that I wished him\n",
      "to fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our\n",
      "dwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me\n",
      "“sir,” Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the\n",
      "room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,—as if it were\n",
      "only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a\n",
      "resting place,—and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the\n",
      "chimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?” asked Herbert, who always\n",
      "presided of a morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thankee, Sir,” said Joe, stiff from head to foot, “I’ll take whichever\n",
      "is most agreeable to yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you say to coffee?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thankee, Sir,” returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,\n",
      "“since you _are_ so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run\n",
      "contrairy to your own opinions. But don’t you never find it a little\n",
      "’eating?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say tea then,” said Herbert, pouring it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Joe’s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of his\n",
      "chair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it\n",
      "were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again\n",
      "soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Were it yesterday afternoon?” said Joe, after coughing behind his\n",
      "hand, as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came.\n",
      "“No it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon” (with\n",
      "an appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you seen anything of London yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, yes, Sir,” said Joe, “me and Wopsle went off straight to look at\n",
      "the Blacking Ware’us. But we didn’t find that it come up to its\n",
      "likeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,” added\n",

      "I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily\n",
      "expressive to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect\n",
      "Chorus, but for his attention being providentially attracted by his\n",
      "hat, which was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constant\n",
      "attention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by\n",
      "wicket-keeping. He made extraordinary play with it, and showed the\n",
      "greatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as it\n",
      "dropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humouring\n",
      "it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern\n",
      "of the paper on the wall, before he felt it safe to close with it;\n",

      "to that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why\n",
      "should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his\n",
      "holiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of\n",
      "meditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had\n",
      "his eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such\n",
      "remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more\n",

      "were, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.\n",

      "reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin\n",

      "tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots\n",
      "in the archway of the Blue Boar’s posting-yard; it was almost solemn to\n",
      "imagine him casually produced in the tailor’s shop, and confounding the\n",
      "disrespectful senses of Trabb’s boy. On the other hand, Trabb’s boy\n",
      "might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless\n",
      "and desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High\n",
      "Street. My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve. On the\n",
      "whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.\n",

      "It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as\n",
      "winter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until\n",
      "two or three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys\n",

      "\n",
      "At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards\n",
      "by stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside\n",
      "passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling\n",
      "their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised\n",
      "when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were\n",
      "two convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old\n",

      "They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler\n",

      "The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their\n",
      "legs,—irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I\n",
      "likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a\n",
      "thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good\n",
      "understanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at\n",
      "the putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts\n",
      "were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he\n",
      "the Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and\n",
      "appeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the\n",
      "world, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller\n",
      "suit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those\n",
      "shapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his\n",
      "half-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on\n",
      "the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had\n",
      "brought me down with his invisible gun!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had\n",
      "never seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye\n",
      "appraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said\n",
      "something to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves\n",
      "round with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something\n",
      "else. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors;\n",
      "their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower\n",
      "animals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with\n",
      "pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them\n",
      "and kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable\n",
      "and degraded spectacle.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the\n",
      "back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and\n",
      "that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in\n",
      "front behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had\n",
      "taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion,\n",
      "and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such\n",
      "villainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and\n",
      "infamous, and shameful, and I don’t know what else. At this time the\n",
      "coach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing\n",
      "to get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,—bringing\n",
      "with them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and\n",
      "hearthstone, which attends the convict presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t take it so much amiss, sir,” pleaded the keeper to the angry\n",

      "cracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.—As I really think I\n",
      "should have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so\n",
      "despised.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,\n",
      "and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So\n",
      "he got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into\n",
      "the place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as\n",
      "they could, and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with his\n",
      "breath on the hair of my head.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict’s\n",
      "breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The\n",
      "sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and\n",
      "searching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more\n",
      "breathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in\n",
      "doing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side,\n",
      "in my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us\n",
      "all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way\n",
      "House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed\n",
      "off, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a\n",
      "couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,\n",
      "and how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I\n",
      "were going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the\n",
      "question up again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I\n",
      "could recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and\n",
      "shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that\n",
      "blew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against\n",
      "the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first\n",
      "words I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of\n",
      "my own thought, “Two One Pound notes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How did he get ’em?” said the convict I had never seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How should I know?” returned the other. “He had ’em stowed away\n",
      "somehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish,” said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, “that I\n",
      "had ’em here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two one pound notes, or friends?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two one pound notes. I’d sell all the friends I ever had for one, and\n",
      "think it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says—?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So he says,” resumed the convict I had recognised,—“it was all said\n",
      "and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the\n",
      "Dock-yard,—‘You’re a-going to be discharged?’ Yes, I was. Would I find\n",
      "out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two\n",
      "one pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“More fool you,” growled the other. “I’d have spent ’em on a Man, in\n",
      "wittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed\n",
      "nothing of you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a ha’porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried\n",
      "again for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And was that—Honour!—the only time you worked out, in this part of the\n",
      "country?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The only time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What might have been your opinion of the place?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,\n",
      "mist, and mudbank.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually\n",
      "growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and\n",
      "been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling\n",
      "certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not\n",
      "only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and\n",
      "so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could\n",
      "have known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our\n",
      "being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a\n",
      "dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in\n",
      "his hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as\n",
      "soon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This\n",
      "device I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot\n",
      "under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down\n",
      "before me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the\n",
      "first stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their\n",
      "way with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off\n",
      "to the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting\n",
      "for them at the slime-washed stairs,—again heard the gruff “Give way,\n",

      "undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on\n",
      "to the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension\n",
      "of a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am\n",
      "confident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the\n",

      "“Burn me twice over, if I can say!” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in\n",
      "my thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage,\n",
      "while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who\n",
      "appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason\n",
      "of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said she. “You, is it, Mr. Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family\n",
      "are all well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are they any wiser?” said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head;\n",
      "“they had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know\n",
      "your way, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I\n",
      "ascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old\n",
      "way at the door of Miss Havisham’s room. “Pip’s rap,” I heard her say,\n",
      "immediately; “come in, Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two\n",
      "hands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on\n",
      "the fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been\n",
      "worn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an\n",
      "elegant lady whom I had never seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come in, Pip,” Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking\n",
      "round or up; “come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as\n",
      "if I were a queen, eh?—Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a\n",
      "grimly playful manner,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heard, Miss Havisham,” said I, rather at a loss, “that you were so\n",
      "kind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked\n",
      "archly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella’s eyes. But she\n",
      "was so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,\n",
      "in all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, that\n",
      "I seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that I\n",
      "slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O the\n",
      "sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the\n",
      "inaccessibility that came about her!\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt\n",
      "in seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a\n",
      "long, long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you find her much changed, Pip?” asked Miss Havisham, with her\n",
      "greedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between\n",
      "them, as a sign to me to sit down there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella\n",
      "in the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into\n",
      "the old—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?” Miss Havisham\n",
      "interrupted. “She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away\n",
      "from her. Don’t you remember?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better\n",
      "then, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she\n",
      "had no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very\n",
      "disagreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is _he_ changed?” Miss Havisham asked her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much,” said Estella, looking at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Less coarse and common?” said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella’s\n",
      "hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,\n",
      "and looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,\n",
      "but she lured me on.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so\n",
      "wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from\n",
      "France, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,\n",
      "she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that\n",
      "it was impossible and out of nature—or I thought so—to separate them\n",
      "from her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence\n",
      "from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had\n",
      "disturbed my boyhood,—from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had\n",
      "first made me ashamed of home and Joe,—from all those visions that had\n",
      "raised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the\n",
      "anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden\n",
      "window of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me\n",
      "to separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life\n",
      "of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and\n",
      "return to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had\n",
      "conversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the\n",
      "neglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel\n",
      "her about a little, as in times of yore.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I\n",
      "had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;\n",
      "I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,\n",
      "quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As\n",
      "we drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight\n",
      "that day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You rewarded me very much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did I?” she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. “I remember I\n",
      "entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill\n",
      "that he should be brought here to pester me with his company.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He and I are great friends now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish\n",
      "look, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your\n",
      "companions,” said Estella.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Naturally,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And necessarily,” she added, in a haughty tone; “what was fit company\n",
      "for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering\n",
      "intention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put\n",
      "it to flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?” said\n",
      "Estella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting\n",
      "times.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not the least.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my\n",
      "side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at\n",
      "hers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me\n",
      "more than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being\n",
      "so set apart for her and assigned to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and\n",
      "after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again\n",
      "into the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her\n",
      "walking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and\n",
      "careless look in that direction, “Did I?” I reminded her where she had\n",
      "come out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, “I\n",
      "don’t remember.” “Not remember that you made me cry?” said I. “No,”\n",
      "said she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe\n",
      "that her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry\n",
      "again, inwardly,—and that is the sharpest crying of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must know,” said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and\n",
      "beautiful woman might, “that I have no heart,—if that has anything to\n",
      "do with my memory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of\n",
      "doubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty\n",
      "without it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,” said\n",
      "Estella, “and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But\n",
      "you know what I mean. I have no softness there,\n",
      "no—sympathy—sentiment—nonsense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What _was_ it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and\n",
      "looked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?\n",
      "No. In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of\n",
      "resemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been\n",
      "acquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much\n",
      "associated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will\n",
      "produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces\n",
      "that are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this to\n",
      "Miss Havisham. I looked again, and though she was still looking at me,\n",
      "the suggestion was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "What _was_ it?\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am serious,” said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow\n",
      "was smooth) as with a darkening of her face; “if we are to be thrown\n",
      "much together, you had better believe it at once. No!” imperiously\n",
      "stopping me as I opened my lips. “I have not bestowed my tenderness\n",
      "anywhere. I have never had any such thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she\n",
      "pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same\n",
      "first day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to\n",
      "have seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand,\n",
      "again the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed\n",
      "me. My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm.\n",
      "Instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "What _was_ it?\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter?” asked Estella. “Are you scared again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should be, if I believed what you said just now,” I replied, to turn\n",
      "it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you don’t? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will\n",
      "soon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be\n",
      "laid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round\n",
      "of the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my\n",
      "cruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand\n",
      "now, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We\n",
      "walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in\n",
      "bloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of\n",
      "the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it\n",
      "could not have been more cherished in my remembrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;\n",
      "we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more\n",
      "in her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her\n",
      "beauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my\n",
      "delight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness\n",
      "had chosen us for one another. Wretched boy!\n",
      "\n",
      "At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,\n",
      "that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and\n",
      "would come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in\n",
      "the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while\n",
      "we were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began\n",
      "the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But, in\n",
      "the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the\n",
      "chair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and\n",
      "beautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,\n",
      "and Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre\n",
      "of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms\n",
      "stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow\n",
      "cloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the\n",
      "door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity\n",
      "that was of its kind quite dreadful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and\n",
      "said in a whisper,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as\n",
      "she sat in the chair. “Love her, love her, love her! How does she use\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question\n",
      "at all) she repeated, “Love her, love her, love her! If she favours\n",
      "you, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to\n",
      "pieces,—and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,—love\n",
      "her, love her, love her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her\n",
      "utterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm\n",
      "round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,\n",
      "to be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.\n",
      "Love her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she\n",
      "meant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead\n",
      "of love—despair—revenge—dire death—it could not have sounded from her\n",
      "lips more like a curse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you,” said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,\n",
      "“what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning\n",
      "self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself\n",
      "and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the\n",
      "smiter—as I did!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught\n",
      "her round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a\n",
      "dress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck\n",
      "herself against the wall and fallen dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I\n",
      "was conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in\n",
      "the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "He always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a\n",
      "pocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was\n",
      "of great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a\n",
      "client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief\n",
      "as if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, as\n",
      "if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or\n",
      "witness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed\n",
      "directly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he\n",
      "had this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking\n",
      "at us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent\n",
      "pause in that attitude, “Indeed? Singular!” and then put the\n",
      "handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else)\n",
      "afraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and\n",
      "stammered that he was as punctual as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As punctual as ever,” he repeated, coming up to us. “(How do you do,\n",
      "Pip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you\n",
      "are here, Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to\n",
      "come and see Estella. To which he replied, “Ah! Very fine young lady!”\n",
      "Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his\n",
      "large hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket\n",
      "were full of secrets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?” said he, when\n",
      "he came to a stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How often?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Certainly not so many.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twice?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jaggers,” interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, “leave my Pip\n",
      "alone, and go with him to your dinner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While\n",
      "we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved\n",
      "yard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat\n",
      "and drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred\n",
      "times and once.\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered, and said, “Never.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And never will, Pip,” he retorted, with a frowning smile. “She has\n",
      "never allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this\n",
      "present life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays\n",
      "hands on such food as she takes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray, sir,” said I, “may I ask you a question?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may,” said he, “and I may decline to answer it. Put your\n",
      "question.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Estella’s name. Is it Havisham or—?” I had nothing to add.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or what?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it Havisham?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is Havisham.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited\n",
      "us. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my green\n",
      "and yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a\n",
      "maid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but\n",
      "who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole\n",
      "time. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my\n",
      "guardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the\n",
      "two ladies left us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that\n",
      "roof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to\n",
      "himself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella’s face once during\n",
      "dinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,\n",
      "but never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often\n",
      "looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his\n",
      "face never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a\n",
      "dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often\n",
      "referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,\n",
      "he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he\n",
      "extorted—and even did extort, though I don’t know how—those references\n",

      "dreaming, curiously mixed in him.”\n",

      "\n",

      "ground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of\n",
      "one person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the\n",
      "best, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what\n",

      "overlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn’t you tell me that\n",
      "your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were\n",
      "not endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you\n",
      "so,—though that is a very large If, I grant,—could you believe that of\n",

      "\n",
      "“I should think it _was_ a strong point,” said Herbert, “and I should\n",
      "think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you\n",
      "must bide your guardian’s time, and he must bide his client’s time.\n",
      "You’ll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then\n",

      "nearer getting it, for it must come at last.”\n",

      "cheery ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ought to have,” said Herbert, “for I have not much else. I must\n",
      "acknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is\n",
      "not my own, but my father’s. The only remark I ever heard him make on\n",
      "your story, was the final one, “The thing is settled and done, or Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers would not be in it.” And now before I say anything more about\n",
      "my father, or my father’s son, and repay confidence with confidence, I\n",

      "moment,—positively repulsive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won’t succeed,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O yes I shall!” said he. “One, two, three, and now I am in for it.\n",
      "Handel, my good fellow;”—though he spoke in this light tone, he was\n",
      "very much in earnest,—“I have been thinking since we have been talking\n",
      "with our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition\n",
      "of your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am\n",
      "I right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never\n",
      "referred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,\n",
      "for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage\n",
      "ultimately?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes, upon my\n",
      "soul and honour! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself\n",
      "from her?—I told you I should be disagreeable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old\n",
      "marsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had\n",
      "subdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were\n",
      "solemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post,\n",
      "smote upon my heart again. There was silence between us for a little\n",
      "while.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; but my dear Handel,” Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,\n",
      "instead of silent, “its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of\n",
      "a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very\n",
      "serious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of\n",
      "what she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may\n",
      "lead to miserable things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know it, Herbert,” said I, with my head still turned away, “but I\n",

      "agreeable again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in\n",
      "their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,\n",
      "looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and\n",

      "of the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are\n",
      "always most particularly anxious to be married?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, “Is it\n",
      "so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” said Herbert, “that’s what I want to know. Because it\n",
      "is decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next\n",
      "me and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little\n",
      "Jane is the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you\n",
      "might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual\n",
      "contemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already\n",
      "made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew.\n",
      "And indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you are?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am,” said Herbert; “but it’s a secret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favoured with\n",
      "further particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my\n",
      "weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I ask the name?” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Name of Clara,” said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Live in London?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, perhaps I ought to mention,” said Herbert, who had become\n",
      "curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting\n",
      "theme, “that she is rather below my mother’s nonsensical family\n",
      "notions. Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships.\n",
      "I think he was a species of purser.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is he now?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s an invalid now,” replied Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Living on—?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the first floor,” said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,\n",
      "for I had intended my question to apply to his means. “I have never\n",
      "seen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known\n",
      "Clara. But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous\n",
      "rows,—roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.” In\n",
      "looking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time\n",
      "recovered his usual lively manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you expect to see him?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O yes, I constantly expect to see him,” returned Herbert, “because I\n",
      "never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the\n",
      "ceiling. But I don’t know how long the rafters may hold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told\n",
      "me that the moment he began to realise Capital, it was his intention to\n",
      "marry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition,\n",
      "engendering low spirits, “But you _can’t_ marry, you know, while you’re\n",
      "looking about you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision\n",
      "to realise this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my\n",
      "pockets. A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my\n",
      "attention, I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received\n",
      "from Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian\n",
      "renown. “And bless my heart,” I involuntarily added aloud, “it’s\n",
      "to-night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve\n",
      "to go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet\n",
      "Herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable\n",
      "means, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me\n",
      "by reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had\n",
      "warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our\n",
      "candles, made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest\n",

      "\n",
      "On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country\n",
      "elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The\n",
      "whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble\n",
      "boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer\n",
      "with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in\n",
      "life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of\n",
      "white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My\n",
      "gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could\n",
      "have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action\n",
      "proceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have been\n",
      "troubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it\n",
      "with him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom\n",
      "also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had\n",
      "the appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of\n",
      "anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were\n",
      "suggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led\n",
      "to the Shade’s being advised by the gallery to “turn over!”—a\n",
      "recommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted\n",
      "of this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of\n",
      "having been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it\n",
      "perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its\n",
      "terrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom\n",
      "lady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public\n",
      "to have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem\n",
      "by a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her\n",
      "waist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so\n",
      "that she was openly mentioned as “the kettle-drum.” The noble boy in\n",
      "the ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were\n",
      "in one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a\n",
      "clergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court\n",
      "fencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice\n",
      "discrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a\n",
      "want of toleration for him, and even—on his being detected in holy\n",
      "orders, and declining to perform the funeral service—to the general\n",
      "indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such\n",
      "slow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off\n",
      "her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who\n",
      "had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the\n",
      "front row of the gallery, growled, “Now the baby’s put to bed let’s\n",
      "have supper!” Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with\n",
      "playful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or\n",
      "state a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on\n",
      "the question whether ’twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared\n",
      "yes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said “Toss up for\n",
      "it;” and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such\n",
      "fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged\n",
      "with loud cries of “Hear, hear!” When he appeared with his stocking\n",
      "disordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very\n",
      "neat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat\n",
      "iron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness\n",
      "of his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had\n",
      "given him. On his taking the recorders,—very like a little black flute\n",
      "that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the\n",
      "door,—he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he\n",
      "recommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said,\n",
      "“And don’t _you_ do it, neither; you’re a deal worse than _him_!” And I\n",
      "grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of\n",
      "these occasions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the\n",
      "appearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical\n",
      "wash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in\n",
      "a comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,\n",
      "the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, “Look out! Here’s the\n",
      "undertaker a coming, to see how you’re a getting on with your work!” I\n",
      "believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle\n",
      "could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,\n",
      "without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;\n",
      "but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without\n",
      "the comment, “Wai-ter!” The arrival of the body for interment (in an\n",
      "empty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a\n",
      "general joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the\n",
      "bearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended\n",
      "Mr. Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the\n",
      "orchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the\n",
      "king off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles\n",
      "upward.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;\n",
      "but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,\n",
      "feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I\n",
      "laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;\n",
      "and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly\n",
      "fine in Mr. Wopsle’s elocution,—not for old associations’ sake, I am\n",
      "afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and\n",
      "downhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural\n",
      "circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.\n",
      "When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I\n",
      "said to Herbert, “Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough\n",
      "either. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy\n",
      "smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we\n",
      "came up with him,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Pip and friend?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said I. “Yes. Shall we follow you?”\n",
      "\n",

      "asked, “How did you think he looked?—I dressed him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the\n",
      "addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue\n",
      "ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some\n",
      "extraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When he come to the grave,” said our conductor, “he showed his cloak\n",
      "beautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he see\n",
      "the ghost in the queen’s apartment, he might have made more of his\n",
      "stockings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,\n",
      "into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle\n",
      "was divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just\n",
      "room for us to look at him over one another’s shoulders, by keeping the\n",
      "packing-case door, or lid, wide open.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Wopsle, “I am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,\n",
      "you will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in\n",
      "former times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been\n",
      "acknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to\n",
      "get himself out of his princely sables.\n",

      "“Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,” said the owner of that\n",
      "property, “or you’ll bust ’em. Bust ’em, and you’ll bust\n",
      "five-and-thirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a\n",
      "finer pair. Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave ’em to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who,\n",
      "on the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over\n",
      "backward with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then,\n",
      "Mr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), “Capitally.” So\n",
      "I said “Capitally.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?” said Mr.\n",
      "Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert said from behind (again poking me), “Massive and concrete.” So\n",
      "I said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon\n",
      "it, “Massive and concrete.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver,\n",
      "with an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall\n",
      "at the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I’ll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,” said the man who was\n",
      "on his knees, “in which you’re out in your reading. Now mind! I don’t\n",
      "care who says contrairy; I tell you so. You’re out in your reading of\n",
      "Hamlet when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed,\n",
      "made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to\n",
      "put a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal\n",
      "(which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and\n",
      "whenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out “I don’t\n",
      "see no wafers!” And at night his reading was lovely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say “a faithful\n",
      "Dependent—I overlook his folly;” and then said aloud, “My view is a\n",
      "little classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve,\n",
      "they will improve.”\n",

      "Herbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.\n",

      "mean, the representation?”\n",
      "\n",
      "We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I\n",
      "added, “He was drunk, no doubt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O dear no, sir,” said Mr. Wopsle, “not drunk. His employer would see\n",

      "\n",
      "“You know his employer?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both\n",

      "expressive of low malignity, who went through—I will not say\n",
      "sustained—the rôle (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, King\n",
      "of Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for\n",
      "Mr. Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,\n",
      "that I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put\n",
      "on,—which jostled us out at the doorway,—to ask Herbert what he thought\n",
      "of having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would be kind\n",
      "to do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard’s with us,\n",
      "wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat until\n",
      "two o’clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing his\n",
      "plans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general\n",
      "recollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end\n",

      "eye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry\n",
      "whether I had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and\n",
      "ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the\n",
      "trying of his temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be\n",
      "expected,—which I knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoined\n",
      "Mr. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by\n",
      "the information I had received, accepted his offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge\n",
      "where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison\n",
      "rules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much\n",
      "neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all\n",
      "public wrongdoing—and which is always its heaviest and longest\n",
      "punishment—was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better\n",
      "than soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their\n",
      "prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their\n",
      "soup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was\n",
      "going his rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards,\n",
      "were buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly,\n",
      "disorderly, depressing scene it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener\n",
      "might walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his\n",
      "seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, “What,\n",
      "Captain Tom? Are _you_ there? Ah, indeed!” and also, “Is that Black\n",
      "Bill behind the cistern? Why I didn’t look for you these two months;\n",
      "how do you find yourself?” Equally in his stopping at the bars and\n",
      "attending to anxious whisperers,—always singly,—Wemmick with his\n",
      "post-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference,\n",
      "as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made,\n",
      "since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department\n",
      "of Mr. Jaggers’s business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers\n",
      "hung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His\n",
      "personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,\n",
      "and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both\n",
      "hands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in\n",
      "his pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting\n",
      "the raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible\n",
      "from the insufficient money produced, said, “it’s no use, my boy. I’m\n",
      "only a subordinate. I can’t take it. Don’t go on in that way with a\n",
      "subordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had\n",
      "better address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals\n",
      "in the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one,\n",
      "may be worth the while of another; that’s my recommendation to you,\n",
      "speaking as a subordinate. Don’t try on useless measures. Why should\n",
      "you? Now, who’s next?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, we walked through Wemmick’s greenhouse, until he turned to me and\n",
      "said, “Notice the man I shall shake hands with.” I should have done so,\n",
      "without the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can see\n",
      "now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat, with a\n",
      "peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that\n",
      "went wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner of\n",
      "the bars, and put his hand to his hat—which had a greasy and fatty\n",
      "surface like cold broth—with a half-serious and half-jocose military\n",
      "salute.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Colonel, to you!” said Wemmick; “how are you, Colonel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, Mr. Wemmick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too\n",
      "strong for us, Colonel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, it was too strong, sir,—but _I_ don’t care.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” said Wemmick, coolly, “_you_ don’t care.” Then, turning to\n",
      "me, “Served His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought\n",
      "his discharge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, “Indeed?” and the man’s eyes looked at me, and then looked over\n",
      "my head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across\n",
      "his lips and laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,” he said to Wemmick.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps,” returned my friend, “but there’s no knowing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,”\n",
      "said the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thankye,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. “Same to you,\n",
      "Colonel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,” said the\n",
      "man, unwilling to let his hand go, “I should have asked the favour of\n",
      "your wearing another ring—in acknowledgment of your attentions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll accept the will for the deed,” said Wemmick. “By the by; you were\n",
      "quite a pigeon-fancier.” The man looked up at the sky. “I am told you\n",
      "had a remarkable breed of tumblers. _Could_ you commission any friend\n",
      "of yours to bring me a pair, if you’ve no further use for ’em?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It shall be done, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” said Wemmick, “they shall be taken care of.\n",
      "Good-afternoon, Colonel. Good-bye!” They shook hands again, and as we\n",
      "walked away Wemmick said to me, “A Coiner, a very good workman. The\n",
      "Recorder’s report is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed on\n",
      "Monday. Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are\n",
      "portable property all the same.” With that, he looked back, and nodded\n",
      "at this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of\n",
      "the yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great\n",
      "importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less than\n",
      "by those whom they held in charge. “Well, Mr. Wemmick,” said the\n",
      "turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,\n",
      "and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, “what’s Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder? Is he going to make it\n",
      "manslaughter, or what’s he going to make of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t you ask him?” returned Wemmick.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O yes, I dare say!” said the turnkey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, that’s the way with them here, Mr. Pip,” remarked Wemmick,\n",
      "turning to me with his post-office elongated. “They don’t mind what\n",
      "they ask of me, the subordinate; but you’ll never catch ’em asking any\n",
      "questions of my principal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is this young gentleman one of the ’prentices or articled ones of your\n",
      "office?” asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick’s humour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There he goes again, you see!” cried Wemmick, “I told you so! Asks\n",
      "another question of the subordinate before his first is dry! Well,\n",
      "supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why then,” said the turnkey, grinning again, “he knows what Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yah!” cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a\n",
      "facetious way, “you’re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do\n",
      "with my principal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I’ll\n",
      "get him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us\n",
      "over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the\n",
      "street.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mind you, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm\n",
      "to be more confidential; “I don’t know that Mr. Jaggers does a better\n",
      "thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He’s always so\n",
      "high. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities.\n",
      "That Colonel durst no more take leave of _him_, than that turnkey durst\n",
      "ask him his intentions respecting a case. Then, between his height and\n",
      "them, he slips in his subordinate,—don’t you see?—and so he has ’em,\n",
      "soul and body.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian’s\n",
      "subtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the\n",
      "first time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where\n",
      "suppliants for Mr. Jaggers’s notice were lingering about as usual, and\n",
      "I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some\n",
      "three hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange\n",
      "it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and\n",
      "crime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter\n",
      "evening, I should have first encountered it; that, it should have\n",
      "reappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded\n",
      "but not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and\n",
      "advancement. While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful\n",
      "young Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with\n",
      "absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her. I wished\n",
      "that Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone\n",
      "with him, so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might not\n",
      "have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust\n",
      "off my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress,\n",
      "and I exhaled its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel,\n",
      "remembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and\n",
      "I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick’s\n",
      "conservatory, when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand\n",
      "waving to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "What _was_ the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had\n",
      "passed?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter XXXIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately\n",
      "beautiful than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was\n",
      "more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I\n",
      "thought I saw Miss Havisham’s influence in the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and\n",
      "when it was all collected I remembered—having forgotten everything but\n",
      "herself in the meanwhile—that I knew nothing of her destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to Richmond,” she told me. “Our lesson is, that there are\n",
      "two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the\n",
      "Surrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage,\n",
      "and you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges\n",
      "out of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I,\n",
      "but to obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own\n",
      "devices, you and I.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an inner\n",
      "meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with\n",
      "displeasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a\n",
      "little?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you\n",
      "are to take care of me the while.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a\n",
      "waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen\n",
      "such a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,\n",
      "he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which he\n",
      "couldn’t find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the\n",
      "establishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous\n",
      "article, considering the hole’s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,\n",
      "and somebody’s pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us\n",
      "into another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a\n",
      "scorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked\n",
      "at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order;\n",
      "which, proving to be merely, “Some tea for the lady,” sent him out of\n",
      "the room in a very low state of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong\n",
      "combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that\n",
      "the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising\n",
      "proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.\n",
      "Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that\n",
      "with her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all\n",
      "happy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are you going to, at Richmond?” I asked Estella.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to live,” said she, “at a great expense, with a lady there,\n",
      "who has the power—or says she has—of taking me about, and introducing\n",
      "me, and showing people to me and showing me to people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I suppose so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She answered so carelessly, that I said, “You speak of yourself as if\n",
      "you were some one else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,” said Estella,\n",
      "smiling delightfully, “you must not expect me to go to school to _you_;\n",
      "I must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I live quite pleasantly there; at least—” It appeared to me that I was\n",
      "losing a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At least?” repeated Estella.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You silly boy,” said Estella, quite composedly, “how can you talk such\n",
      "nonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest\n",
      "of his family?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very superior indeed. He is nobody’s enemy—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t add but his own,” interposed Estella, “for I hate that class of\n",
      "man. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and\n",
      "spite, I have heard?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure I have every reason to say so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,” said\n",
      "Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once\n",
      "grave and rallying, “for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and\n",
      "insinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,\n",
      "write letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment\n",
      "and the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realise to yourself\n",
      "the hatred those people feel for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They do me no harm, I hope?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very\n",
      "singular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When\n",
      "she left off—and she had not laughed languidly, but with real\n",
      "enjoyment—I said, in my diffident way with her,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any\n",
      "harm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no you may be sure of that,” said Estella. “You may be certain\n",
      "that I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and\n",
      "the tortures they undergo!” She laughed again, and even now when she\n",
      "had told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not\n",
      "doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion. I\n",
      "thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw\n",
      "the thought in my mind, and answered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not easy for even you.” said Estella, “to know what satisfaction\n",
      "it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of\n",
      "the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not\n",
      "brought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not\n",
      "your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed\n",
      "and defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that\n",
      "is soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round\n",
      "childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a\n",
      "woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up\n",
      "in the night. I did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these\n",
      "remembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of\n",
      "that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two things I can tell you,” said Estella. “First, notwithstanding the\n",
      "proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your\n",
      "mind at rest that these people never will—never would in a hundred\n",
      "years—impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great\n",
      "or small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so\n",
      "busy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As she gave it to me playfully,—for her darker mood had been but\n",
      "momentary—I held it and put it to my lips. “You ridiculous boy,” said\n",
      "Estella, “will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the\n",
      "same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What spirit was that?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and\n",
      "plotters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you\n",
      "like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue’s. “Now,” said\n",
      "Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, “you are to take\n",
      "care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us,\n",
      "and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our\n",
      "intercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,\n",
      "I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on\n",
      "against trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it\n",
      "always was.\n",
      "\n",
      "I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue,\n",
      "brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of\n",
      "tea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and\n",
      "forks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meek\n",
      "little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron\n",
      "cover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a\n",
      "quantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof\n",
      "impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of\n",
      "bread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in\n",
      "with, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a\n",
      "prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came\n",
      "back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I\n",
      "steeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances\n",
      "extracted one cup of I don’t know what for Estella.\n",
      "\n",

      "and the chambermaid taken into consideration,—in a word, the whole\n",
      "house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella’s\n",
      "purse much lightened,—we got into our post-coach and drove away.\n",
      "Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon\n",
      "under the walls of which I was so ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What place is that?” Estella asked me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it, and then told\n",
      "her. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring,\n",
      "“Wretches!” I would not have confessed to my visit for any\n",
      "consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Jaggers,” said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,\n",
      "“has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place\n",
      "than any man in London.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,” said Estella, in a\n",
      "low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since I\n",
      "can remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could\n",
      "speak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with\n",
      "him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once habituated to his distrustful manner,” said I, “I have done very\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you intimate?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have dined with him at his private house.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“It is a curious place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with\n",
      "her; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe\n",
      "the dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden\n",
      "glare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive\n",
      "with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out\n",
      "of it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in\n",
      "lightning.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by\n",
      "which we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this\n",
      "side of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she\n",
      "told me, for she had never left Miss Havisham’s neighbourhood until she\n",
      "had gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in\n",
      "going and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her\n",
      "while she remained here? To that she emphatically said “God forbid!”\n",
      "and no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;\n",
      "that she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task\n",
      "had needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she\n",
      "had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should\n",
      "have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose\n",
      "to do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to\n",
      "crush it and throw it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew\n",
      "Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I\n",
      "hoped I should see her sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you\n",

      "\n",
      "I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of\n",
      "some station, though not averse to increasing her income.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a part of Miss Havisham’s plans for me, Pip,” said Estella, with\n",
      "a sigh, as if she were tired; “I am to write to her constantly and see\n",
      "her regularly and report how I go on,—I and the jewels,—for they are\n",
      "nearly all mine now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she\n",
      "did so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house\n",
      "by the green,—a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,\n",
      "embroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their\n",
      "court days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still\n",
      "cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and\n",
      "stiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of\n",
      "the dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go\n",
      "the silent way of the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bell with an old voice—which I dare say in its time had often said to\n",

      "sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire—sounded\n",
      "gravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came fluttering\n",
      "out to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she\n",
      "gave me her hand and a smile, and said good-night, and was absorbed\n",
      "likewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I\n",
      "should be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy\n",
      "with her, but always miserable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in\n",
      "with a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At our\n",
      "own door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party\n",
      "escorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite\n",

      "Mr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on\n",
      "domestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children and\n",
      "servants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But\n",
      "Mrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of\n",
      "the baby’s having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him\n",
      "quiet during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot\n",
      "Guards) of Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be\n",

      "him to accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as\n",

      "notice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on\n",
      "my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,\n",
      "but I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of\n",
      "chronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe. My conscience was\n",
      "not by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the\n",
      "night,—like Camilla,—I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits,\n",
      "that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss\n",

      "Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of\n",
      "mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part\n",
      "in its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,\n",
      "and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my\n",
      "satisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the\n",
      "influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so\n",
      "I perceived—though dimly enough perhaps—that it was not beneficial to\n",
      "anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert. My\n",
      "lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not\n",
      "afford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace\n",
      "with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having\n",
      "unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor\n",
      "arts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent,\n",
      "and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them\n",
      "slumbering. But Herbert’s was a very different case, and it often\n",
      "caused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in\n",
      "crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery\n",
      "work, and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began\n",
      "to contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert must\n",
      "begin too, so he soon followed. At Startop’s suggestion, we put\n",
      "ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the\n",
      "Grove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were\n",
      "not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to\n",
      "quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause\n",
      "six waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying\n",
      "social ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I\n",
      "understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast\n",
      "of the society: which ran “Gentlemen, may the present promotion of good\n",
      "feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was in\n",
      "Covent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honour of\n",
      "joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about\n",
      "town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts\n",
      "at the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his\n",
      "equipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion\n",
      "deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way—like\n",
      "coals. But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could\n",
      "not be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of\n",
      "age.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken\n",
      "Herbert’s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make\n",
      "no such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every\n",
      "direction, and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into\n",
      "keeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him\n",
      "with a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about\n",
      "him more hopefully about midday; that he drooped when he came into\n",
      "dinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather\n",
      "clearly, after dinner; that he all but realised Capital towards\n",
      "midnight; and that at about two o’clock in the morning, he became so\n",

      "the opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the\n",
      "general tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere,\n",
      "was a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew\n",
      "greyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by\n",
      "the hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool,\n",
      "read her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about\n",

      "Barnard’s Inn.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people\n",
      "could make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less\n",
      "miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.\n",
      "There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying\n",
      "ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my\n",
      "belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look\n",
      "about him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he\n",
      "consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an\n",
      "almanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I\n",
      "ever saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what we\n",
      "undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a\n",
      "Republic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except\n",
      "at a certain hour of every afternoon to “go to Lloyd’s”—in observance\n",
      "of a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything\n",
      "else in connection with Lloyd’s that I could find out, except come back\n",
      "again. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively\n",
      "must find an opening, he would go on ’Change at a busy time, and walk\n",
      "in and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the\n",
      "assembled magnates. “For,” says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on\n",
      "one of those special occasions, “I find the truth to be, Handel, that\n",
      "an opening won’t come to one, but one must go to it,—so I have been.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated\n",
      "one another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond\n",
      "expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight\n",
      "of the Avenger’s livery; which had a more expensive and a less\n",
      "remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the\n",
      "four-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast\n",
      "became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at\n",
      "breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, “not\n",
      "unwholly unconnected,” as my local paper might put it, “with jewelery,”\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“My dear Handel,” Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, “if you\n",
      "will believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange\n",
      "coincidence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, Herbert,” I would respond, “let us look into our affairs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for\n",
      "this purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to\n",
      "confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And\n",
      "I know Herbert thought so too.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of\n",
      "something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds\n",
      "might be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the\n",
      "mark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of\n",
      "ink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was\n",
      "something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in\n",
      "a neat hand, the heading, “Memorandum of Pip’s debts”; with Barnard’s\n",
      "Inn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet\n",
      "of paper, and write across it with similar formalities, “Memorandum of\n",
      "Herbert’s debts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,\n",
      "which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half\n",
      "burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and\n",
      "otherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us\n",
      "exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to\n",
      "distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually\n",
      "paying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things\n",
      "seemed about equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?\n",
      "Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful\n",
      "manner at the sight of his accumulating figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are mounting up, Handel,” Herbert would say; “upon my life, they\n",
      "are mounting up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be firm, Herbert,” I would retort, plying my own pen with great\n",
      "assiduity. “Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare\n",
      "them out of countenance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So I would, Handel, only they are staring _me_ out of countenance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would\n",
      "fall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the\n",
      "plea that he had not got Cobbs’s bill, or Lobbs’s, or Nobbs’s, as the\n",
      "case might be.\n",
      "\n",

      "down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a fellow of resource you are!” my friend would reply, with\n",
      "admiration. “Really your business powers are very remarkable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, the\n",
      "reputation of a first-rate man of business,—prompt, decisive,\n",
      "energetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities\n",
      "down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My\n",
      "self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.\n",
      "When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,\n",
      "docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical\n",
      "bundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not\n",
      "my administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into\n",
      "a focus for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called\n",
      "“leaving a Margin.” For example; supposing Herbert’s debts to be one\n",
      "hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, “Leave a\n",
      "margin, and put them down at two hundred.” Or, supposing my own to be\n",
      "four times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven\n",
      "hundred. I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin,\n",
      "but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have\n",
      "been an expensive device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately,\n",
      "to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of\n",
      "freedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another\n",
      "margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these\n",
      "examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable\n",
      "opinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert’s\n",
      "compliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the\n",
      "table before me among the stationery, and feel like a Bank of some\n",
      "sort, rather than a private individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we\n",
      "might not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one\n",
      "evening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said\n",
      "door, and fall on the ground. “It’s for you, Handel,” said Herbert,\n",

      "It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and\n",
      "the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my\n",
      "sister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That\n",
      "the place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed\n",
      "unable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my\n",
      "thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming\n",
      "towards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the\n",
      "door. In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated,\n",
      "there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of\n",
      "the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she\n",
      "were still alive and had been often there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my\n",
      "sister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret\n",
      "which may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and\n",
      "perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized\n",
      "with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had\n",
      "suffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have\n",
      "revengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him that\n",
      "I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the\n",
      "curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the\n",
      "morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the\n",
      "forge.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times\n",
      "when I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,\n",
      "vividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that\n",
      "softened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the\n",
      "beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it\n",
      "would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should\n",
      "be softened as they thought of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co.\n",
      "had put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally\n",
      "absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a\n",
      "black bandage,—as if that instrument could possibly communicate any\n",
      "comfort to anybody,—were posted at the front door; and in one of them I\n",
      "recognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young\n",
      "couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of\n",
      "intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped\n",
      "round the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and\n",
      "most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed\n",
      "windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two\n",
      "warders (the postboy) knocked at the door,—implying that I was far too\n",
      "much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a\n",
      "wager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlour. Here, Mr.\n",
      "Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves\n",
      "up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity\n",
      "of black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished\n",
      "putting somebody’s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby;\n",
      "so he held out his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and\n",
      "confused by the occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of\n",
      "warm affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow\n",
      "under his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,\n",
      "as chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent\n",
      "down and said to him, “Dear Joe, how are you?” he said, “Pip, old chap,\n",
      "you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a—” and clasped my hand\n",
      "and said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly\n",
      "here and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as I\n",
      "thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and\n",
      "there began to wonder in what part of the house it—she—my sister—was.\n",
      "The air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I\n",
      "looked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible\n",
      "until one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum\n",
      "cake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and\n",
      "biscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had\n",
      "never seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.\n",
      "Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook\n",
      "in a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately\n",
      "stuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my\n",
      "attention. The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing\n",
      "sherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, “May I, dear sir?” and\n",
      "did. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent\n",
      "speechless paroxysm in a corner. We were all going to “follow,” and\n",
      "were all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) into\n",
      "ridiculous bundles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.\n",
      "Trabb called “formed” in the parlour, two and two,—and it was\n",
      "dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; “which I\n",
      "meantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the\n",
      "church myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it\n",
      "with willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbours\n",
      "would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in\n",
      "respect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!” cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a\n",
      "depressed business-like voice. “Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are\n",
      "ready!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses\n",
      "were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and\n",
      "Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had\n",
      "been brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of\n",
      "Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded\n",
      "under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole\n",
      "looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and\n",
      "blundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,—the postboy and\n",
      "his comrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The neighbourhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and\n",
      "we were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful\n",
      "and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us\n",
      "off, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such\n",
      "times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on\n",
      "our emergence round some corner of expectancy, “_Here_ they come!”\n",
      "“_Here_ they are!” and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was\n",
      "much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted\n",
      "all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband,\n",
      "and smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the\n",
      "excessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited\n",
      "and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the\n",
      "ships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,\n",
      "close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this\n",
      "parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was\n",
      "laid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the\n",
      "light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,\n",
      "I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even\n",
      "when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it\n",
      "brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it\n",
      "fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him\n",
      "cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came\n",
      "unexpectedly into large property. When we got back, he had the\n",
      "hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had\n",
      "done her so much honour, and to hint that she would have considered it\n",
      "reasonably purchased at the price of her death. After that, he drank\n",
      "all the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two\n",
      "talked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) as\n",
      "if they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were\n",
      "notoriously immortal. Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Hubble,—to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly\n",
      "Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest\n",
      "benefactor.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men—but not his Boy; I\n",
      "looked for him—had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,\n",
      "the house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a\n",
      "cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlour, not in the old\n",
      "kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his\n",
      "knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great\n",
      "restraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, and\n",
      "when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down\n",
      "together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I\n",
      "noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to\n",
      "make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in which\n",
      "the dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little\n",
      "room, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great\n",
      "thing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing\n",
      "in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a\n",
      "little talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy,” said I, “I think you might have written to me about these sad\n",
      "matters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you, Mr. Pip?” said Biddy. “I should have written if I had thought\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider\n",
      "that you ought to have thought that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you, Mr. Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with\n",
      "her, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After\n",
      "looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave\n",
      "up that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy\n",
      "dear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! I can’t do so, Mr. Pip,” said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still\n",
      "of quiet conviction. “I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am\n",
      "going to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of\n",
      "Mr. Gargery, together, until he settles down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How am I going to live?” repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary\n",
      "flush upon her face. “I’ll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get\n",
      "the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be\n",
      "well recommended by all the neighbours, and I hope I can be industrious\n",
      "and patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,”\n",
      "pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, “the\n",
      "new schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you\n",
      "after that time, and have had time since then to improve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature,” murmured Biddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!\n",
      "I thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further\n",
      "with Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not heard the particulars of my sister’s death, Biddy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad\n",
      "states—though they had got better of late, rather than worse—for four\n",
      "days, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and\n",
      "said quite plainly, ‘Joe.’ As she had never said any word for a long\n",
      "while, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs\n",
      "to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to\n",
      "put her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid\n",
      "her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she\n",
      "presently said ‘Joe’ again, and once ‘Pardon,’ and once ‘Pip.’ And so\n",
      "she never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later\n",
      "when we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that\n",
      "were coming out, were blurred in my own sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know what is become of Orlick?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in\n",
      "the quarries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course you have seen him then?—Why are you looking at that dark\n",
      "tree in the lane?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw him there, on the night she died.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was not the last time either, Biddy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.—It is of\n",
      "no use,” said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running\n",
      "out, “you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and\n",
      "he is gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by\n",
      "this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told\n",
      "her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of\n",
      "that country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she\n",
      "told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,—she\n",
      "didn’t say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,—but ever did\n",
      "his duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a\n",
      "gentle heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,” said I; “and Biddy,\n",
      "we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often\n",
      "down here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biddy said never a single word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy, don’t you hear me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Mr. Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,—which appears to me to be in\n",
      "bad taste, Biddy,—what do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do I mean?” asked Biddy, timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy,” said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, “I must request\n",
      "to know what you mean by this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By this?” said Biddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, don’t echo,” I retorted. “You used not to echo, Biddy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Used not!” said Biddy. “O Mr. Pip! Used!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another\n",
      "silent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biddy,” said I, “I made a remark respecting my coming down here often,\n",
      "to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the\n",
      "goodness, Biddy, to tell me why.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?” asked\n",
      "Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the\n",
      "stars with a clear and honest eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O dear me!” said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in\n",
      "despair. “This really is a very bad side of human nature! Don’t say any\n",
      "more, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and\n",
      "when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of\n",
      "her as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the\n",
      "churchyard and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the\n",
      "night, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an\n",
      "unkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and\n",
      "looking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There I\n",
      "stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of\n",
      "health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright\n",
      "sun of the life in store for him were shining on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-bye, dear Joe!—No, don’t wipe it off—for God’s sake, give me your\n",

      "and a crust of bread. “Biddy,” said I, when I gave her my hand at\n",

      "“Take a chair, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his\n",
      "boots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time\n",
      "when I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the\n",
      "shelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were\n",
      "making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now my young friend,” my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the\n",
      "box, “I am going to have a word or two with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you please, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you suppose,” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the\n",
      "ground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,—“what\n",
      "do you suppose you are living at the rate of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the rate of, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,\n",
      "“the—rate—of?” And then looked all round the room, and paused with his\n",
      "pocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed\n",
      "any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,\n",
      "I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply\n",
      "seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, “I thought so!” and blew his\n",
      "nose with an air of satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend,” said Mr. Jaggers.\n",
      "“Have you anything to ask _me_?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several\n",
      "questions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ask one,” said Mr. Jaggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Ask another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Waive that, a moment,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and ask another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from\n",
      "the inquiry, “Have-I—anything to receive, sir?” On that, Mr. Jaggers\n",
      "said, triumphantly, “I thought we should come to it!” and called to\n",
      "Wemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it\n",
      "in, and disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Mr. Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “attend, if you please. You have been\n",
      "drawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick’s\n",
      "cash-book; but you are in debt, of course?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid I must say yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know you must say yes; don’t you?” said Mr. Jaggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t ask you what you owe, because you don’t know; and if you did\n",
      "know, you wouldn’t tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,”\n",
      "cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of\n",
      "protesting: “it’s likely enough that you think you wouldn’t, but you\n",
      "would. You’ll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this\n",
      "piece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it\n",
      "and tell me what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a bank-note,” said I, “for five hundred pounds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is a bank-note,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, “for five hundred pounds.\n",
      "And a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How could I do otherwise!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! But answer the question,” said Mr. Jaggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Undoubtedly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that\n",
      "handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this\n",
      "day, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome\n",
      "sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until\n",
      "the donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your\n",
      "money affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from\n",
      "Wemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are\n",
      "in communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere\n",
      "agent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my\n",
      "instructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but\n",
      "I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great\n",
      "liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. “I am\n",
      "not paid, Pip,” said he, coolly, “to carry your words to any one;” and\n",
      "then gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and\n",
      "stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a pause, I hinted,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to\n",
      "waive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it\n",
      "again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me\n",
      "aback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.\n",
      "“Is it likely,” I said, after hesitating, “that my patron, the\n",
      "fountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon—” there I\n",
      "delicately stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will soon what?” asked Mr. Jaggers. “That’s no question as it stands,\n",
      "you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will soon come to London,” said I, after casting about for a precise\n",
      "form of words, “or summon me anywhere else?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, here,” replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with his\n",
      "dark deep-set eyes, “we must revert to the evening when we first\n",
      "encountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then,\n",
      "Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that\n",
      "person appeared.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just so,” said Mr. Jaggers, “that’s my answer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my\n",
      "strong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came\n",
      "quicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I\n",
      "had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers shook his head,—not in negativing the question, but in\n",
      "altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer\n",
      "it,—and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my\n",
      "eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their\n",
      "suspended attention, and were going to sneeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs\n",
      "of his warmed hands, “I’ll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That’s a\n",
      "question I must not be asked. You’ll understand that better, when I\n",
      "tell you it’s a question that might compromise _me_. Come! I’ll go a\n",
      "little further with you; I’ll say something more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the\n",
      "calves of his legs in the pause he made.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When that person discloses,” said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,\n",
      "“you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person\n",
      "discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that\n",
      "person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything\n",
      "about it. And that’s all I have got to say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked\n",
      "thoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion\n",
      "that Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him\n",
      "into her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he\n",
      "resented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did\n",
      "object to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I\n",
      "raised my eyes again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me\n",
      "all the time, and was doing so still.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that is all you have to say, sir,” I remarked, “there can be\n",
      "nothing left for me to say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me\n",
      "where I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.\n",
      "As a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favour us with his\n",
      "company, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on\n",
      "walking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation\n",
      "for him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had\n",
      "his hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk\n",
      "to Wemmick.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my\n",
      "pocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often there\n",
      "before; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise\n",
      "with concerning such thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going\n",
      "home. He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office\n",
      "candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near\n",
      "the door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his\n",
      "hat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest\n",
      "with his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Wemmick,” said I, “I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous\n",
      "to serve a friend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion\n",
      "were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This friend,” I pursued, “is trying to get on in commercial life, but\n",
      "has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a\n",
      "beginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With money down?” said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With _some_ money down,” I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot\n",
      "across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home—“with _some_\n",
      "money down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, “I should like just to run over with you on my\n",
      "fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as\n",
      "Chelsea Reach. Let’s see; there’s London, one; Southwark, two;\n",
      "Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.”\n",
      "He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his\n",
      "safe-key on the palm of his hand. “There’s as many as six, you see, to\n",
      "choose from.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t understand you,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,” returned Wemmick, “and take a walk upon\n",
      "your bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch\n",
      "of your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and\n",
      "you may know the end of it too,—but it’s a less pleasant and profitable\n",
      "end.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after\n",
      "saying this.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is very discouraging,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Meant to be so,” said Wemmick.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then is it your opinion,” I inquired, with some little indignation,\n",
      "“that a man should never—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“—Invest portable property in a friend?” said Wemmick. “Certainly he\n",
      "should not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,—and then it\n",
      "becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get\n",
      "rid of him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that,” said I, “is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That,” he returned, “is my deliberate opinion in this office.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole\n",
      "here; “but would that be your opinion at Walworth?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Pip,” he replied, with gravity, “Walworth is one place, and this\n",
      "office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is\n",
      "another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments\n",
      "must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken\n",
      "in this office.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well,” said I, much relieved, “then I shall look you up at\n",
      "Walworth, you may depend upon it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Pip,” he returned, “you will be welcome there, in a private and\n",
      "personal capacity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my\n",
      "guardian’s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in\n",
      "his doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and\n",
      "stood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the street\n",
      "together, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers and I turned ours.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers\n",
      "had had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a\n",
      "Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable\n",
      "consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all\n",
      "seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he\n",
      "made of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than\n",
      "Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to\n",
      "dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy,\n",
      "because, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes\n",
      "fixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and\n",
      "forgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.\n",

      "Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick’s Walworth\n",
      "sentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage\n",
      "to the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union\n",
      "Jack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of\n",
      "defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most\n",
      "pacific manner by the Aged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My son, sir,” said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, “rather\n",
      "had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word\n",
      "that he would soon be home from his afternoon’s walk. He is very\n",
      "regular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my\n",
      "son.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and\n",
      "we went in and sat down by the fireside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You made acquaintance with my son, sir,” said the old man, in his\n",
      "chirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, “at his office, I\n",
      "expect?” I nodded. “Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand\n",
      "at his business, sir?” I nodded hard. “Yes; so they tell me. His\n",
      "business is the Law?” I nodded harder. “Which makes it more surprising\n",
      "in my son,” said the old man, “for he was not brought up to the Law,\n",
      "but to the Wine-Coopering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the\n",
      "reputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into\n",
      "the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very\n",
      "sprightly manner, “No, to be sure; you’re right.” And to this hour I\n",
      "have not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I\n",
      "had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making\n",
      "some other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his\n",
      "own calling in life had been “the Wine-Coopering.” By dint of straining\n",
      "that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on\n",
      "the chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my\n",
      "meaning understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the old gentleman; “the warehousing, the warehousing. First,\n",
      "over yonder;” he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he\n",
      "intended to refer me to Liverpool; “and then in the City of London\n",
      "here. However, having an infirmity—for I am hard of hearing, sir—”\n",
      "\n",
      "I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he\n",
      "went into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and\n",
      "little made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to\n",
      "what you said, you know,” pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,\n",
      "“what I say is, No to be sure; you’re right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled\n",
      "me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this\n",
      "imaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall\n",
      "on one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little\n",
      "wooden flap with “JOHN” upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried\n",
      "with great triumph, “My son’s come home!” and we both went out to the\n",
      "drawbridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the\n",
      "other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with\n",
      "the greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,\n",
      "that I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had\n",
      "come across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he\n",
      "was accompanied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in\n",
      "the post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two or\n",
      "three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed\n",
      "of portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both\n",
      "before and behind, made her figure very like a boy’s kite; and I might\n",
      "have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves\n",
      "a little too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of\n",
      "fellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in\n",
      "discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our\n",
      "going in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for\n",
      "announcing himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a\n",
      "moment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently\n",
      "another click came, and another little door tumbled open with “Miss\n",
      "Skiffins” on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then\n",
      "Miss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up\n",
      "together. On Wemmick’s return from working these mechanical appliances,\n",
      "I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he\n",
      "said, “Well, you know, they’re both pleasant and useful to the Aged.\n",
      "And by George, sir, it’s a thing worth mentioning, that of all the\n",
      "people who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known\n",
      "to the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And Mr. Wemmick made them,” added Miss Skiffins, “with his own hands\n",
      "out of his own head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green\n",
      "gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was\n",
      "company), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the\n",
      "property, and see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he\n",
      "did this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I\n",
      "seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I\n",
      "had never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in\n",
      "behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how\n",
      "we had fought. I glanced at Herbert’s home, and at his character, and\n",
      "at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;\n",
      "those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had\n",
      "derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I\n",
      "confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might\n",
      "have done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham\n",
      "in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the\n",
      "possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the\n",
      "certainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any\n",
      "mean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told\n",
      "Wemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a\n",
      "great affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some\n",
      "rays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick’s experience\n",
      "and knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my\n",
      "resources to help Herbert to some present income,—say of a hundred a\n",
      "year, to keep him in good hope and heart,—and gradually to buy him on\n",
      "to some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to\n",
      "understand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert’s\n",
      "knowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world\n",
      "with whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon his\n",
      "shoulder, and saying, “I can’t help confiding in you, though I know it\n",
      "must be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever\n",
      "brought me here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of\n",
      "start, “Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is\n",
      "devilish good of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say you’ll help me to be good then,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ecod,” replied Wemmick, shaking his head, “that’s not my trade.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor is this your trading-place,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are right,” he returned. “You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,\n",
      "I’ll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be\n",
      "done by degrees. Skiffins (that’s her brother) is an accountant and\n",
      "agent. I’ll look him up and go to work for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thank you ten thousand times.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the contrary,” said he, “I thank you, for though we are strictly in\n",
      "our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there\n",
      "_are_ Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned\n",
      "into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The\n",
      "responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and\n",
      "that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me\n",
      "in some danger of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were\n",
      "going to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a\n",
      "hay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as\n",
      "it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss\n",
      "Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises\n",
      "became strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire to\n",
      "participate in the entertainment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right\n",
      "moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth\n",
      "as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed\n",
      "the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of\n",
      "John and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some\n",
      "spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I\n",
      "got used to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss\n",
      "Skiffins’s arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and\n",
      "I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the\n",
      "profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very\n",
      "new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by\n",
      "Wemmick.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was\n",
      "delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged\n",
      "especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage\n",
      "tribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins—in the\n",
      "absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of\n",
      "her family on Sunday afternoons—washed up the tea-things, in a trifling\n",
      "lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on\n",
      "her gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, “Now,\n",
      "Aged Parent, tip us the paper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that\n",
      "this was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman\n",
      "infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. “I won’t offer an\n",
      "apology,” said Wemmick, “for he isn’t capable of many pleasures—are\n",
      "you, Aged P.?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, John, all right,” returned the old man, seeing himself\n",
      "spoken to.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,”\n",
      "said Wemmick, “and he’ll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,\n",
      "Aged One.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, John, all right!” returned the cheerful old man, so busy\n",
      "and so pleased, that it really was quite charming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Aged’s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle’s\n",
      "great-aunt’s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come\n",
      "through a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was\n",
      "always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into\n",
      "them, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was\n",
      "equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,\n",
      "quite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we all\n",
      "expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he\n",
      "resumed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a\n",
      "shadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.\n",
      "Wemmick’s mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually\n",
      "stealing his arm round Miss Skiffins’s waist. In course of time I saw\n",
      "his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment\n",
      "Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm\n",
      "again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest\n",
      "deliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins’s composure\n",
      "while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever\n",
      "seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction\n",
      "of mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it\n",
      "mechanically.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by, I noticed Wemmick’s arm beginning to disappear again, and\n",
      "gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to\n",
      "widen again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite\n",
      "enthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side\n",
      "of Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness\n",
      "of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid\n",
      "it on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am\n",
      "justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged’s reading,\n",
      "Wemmick’s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled\n",
      "to it by Miss Skiffins.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time\n",
      "for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black\n",
      "bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical\n",
      "dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these\n",
      "appliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who\n",
      "was soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and\n",
      "Wemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer\n",
      "to see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had\n",
      "best go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and\n",
      "having passed a pleasant evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,\n",
      "stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter\n",
      "appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would\n",
      "be glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out to\n",
      "Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by\n",
      "appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication\n",
      "with him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that\n",
      "we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long\n",
      "established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted\n",
      "capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a\n",
      "partner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which\n",
      "Herbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds\n",
      "down, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at\n",
      "certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my\n",
      "property. Miss Skiffins’s brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick\n",
      "pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the\n",
      "least suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the\n",
      "radiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a\n",
      "mighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the\n",
      "young merchant’s name), and of Clarriker’s having shown an\n",
      "extraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the\n",
      "opening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his\n",
      "face brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionate\n",
      "friend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of\n",
      "triumph when I saw him so happy. At length, the thing being done, and\n",
      "he having that day entered Clarriker’s House, and he having talked to\n",
      "me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really\n",
      "cry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations\n",
      "had done some good to somebody.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my\n",
      "view. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all\n",
      "the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not\n",
      "much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter XXXVIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to\n",
      "be haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O\n",
      "the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within\n",
      "me haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it\n",
      "would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that\n",
      "house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a\n",
      "widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother\n",
      "looked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother’s complexion was\n",
      "pink, and the daughter’s was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,\n",
      "and the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good\n",
      "position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,\n",
      "if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but\n",
      "the understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and\n",
      "that she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss\n",
      "Havisham’s before the time of her seclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Mrs. Brandley’s house and out of Mrs. Brandley’s house, I suffered\n",
      "every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The\n",
      "nature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of\n",
      "familiarity without placing me on terms of favour, conduced to my\n",
      "distraction. She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned\n",
      "the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a\n",
      "constant slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary,\n",
      "steward, half-brother, poor relation,—if I had been a younger brother\n",
      "of her appointed husband,—I could not have seemed to myself further\n",
      "from my hopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her\n",
      "by her name and hearing her call me by mine became, under the\n",
      "circumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely\n",
      "that it almost maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it\n",
      "almost maddened me.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of\n",
      "every one who went near her; but there were more than enough of them\n",
      "without that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used\n",
      "often to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,\n",
      "fête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,\n",
      "through which I pursued her,—and they were all miseries to me. I never\n",
      "had one hour’s happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the\n",
      "four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with\n",
      "me unto death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout this part of our intercourse,—and it lasted, as will\n",
      "presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,—she habitually\n",
      "reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced\n",
      "upon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden check\n",
      "in this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pip, Pip,” she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat\n",
      "apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; “will you never\n",
      "take warning?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do I mean! If you don’t know what I mean, you are blind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the\n",
      "reason that I always was restrained—and this was not the least of my\n",
      "miseries—by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,\n",
      "when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My\n",
      "dread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy\n",
      "disadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious\n",
      "struggle in her bosom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At any rate,” said I, “I have no warning given me just now, for you\n",
      "wrote to me to come to you, this time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s true,” said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always\n",
      "chilled me.\n",
      "\n",
      "After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on\n",
      "to say:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day\n",
      "at Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She\n",
      "would rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,\n",
      "for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can\n",
      "you take me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can I take you, Estella!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay\n",
      "all charges out of my purse. You hear the condition of your going?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And must obey,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others\n",
      "like it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as\n",
      "seen her handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we\n",
      "found her in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless\n",
      "to add that there was no change in Satis House.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I\n",
      "last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was\n",
      "something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.\n",
      "She hung upon Estella’s beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her\n",
      "gestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked\n",
      "at her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had\n",
      "reared.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to\n",
      "pry into my heart and probe its wounds. “How does she use you, Pip; how\n",
      "does she use you?” she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,\n",
      "even in Estella’s hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire at\n",
      "night, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella’s hand drawn\n",
      "through her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, by\n",
      "dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular\n",
      "letters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;\n",
      "and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind\n",
      "mortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch\n",
      "stick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a\n",
      "very spectre.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of\n",
      "dependence and even of degradation that it awakened,—I saw in this that\n",
      "Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham’s revenge on men, and that she\n",
      "was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw\n",
      "in this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her\n",
      "out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with\n",
      "the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,\n",
      "and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in\n",
      "this that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even\n",
      "while the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my\n",
      "being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian’s\n",
      "declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.\n",
      "In a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there\n",
      "before my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in\n",
      "this, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which\n",
      "her life was hidden from the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on\n",
      "the wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the\n",
      "steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I\n",
      "looked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the\n",
      "stopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the\n",
      "table and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly\n",
      "reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I\n",
      "saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated\n",
      "and thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across\n",
      "the landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it\n",
      "were, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the\n",
      "crawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as\n",
      "they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the\n",
      "gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose\n",
      "between Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever\n",
      "seen them opposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham\n",
      "still had Estella’s arm drawn through her own, and still clutched\n",
      "Estella’s hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.\n",
      "She had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather\n",
      "endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, “are you tired\n",

      "\n",
      "“Are you not?” was the fierce retort.\n",
      "\n",

      "failure; in short, take me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O, look at her, look at her!” cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; “Look at\n",
      "her so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I\n",
      "took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its\n",

      "what would you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe\n",
      "everything to you. What would you have?”\n",
      "\n",

      "from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,\n",
      "that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her\n",
      "enemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had\n",
      "blighted you and would else blight her;—if you had done this, and then,\n",
      "for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she\n",

      "\n",
      "Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor,\n",
      "among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took\n",
      "advantage of the moment—I had sought one from the first—to leave the\n",
      "room, after beseeching Estella’s attention to her, with a movement of\n",
      "my hand. When I left, Estella was yet standing by the great\n",
      "chimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout. Miss Havisham’s grey\n",
      "hair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and\n",
      "was a miserable sight to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an\n",
      "hour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about\n",
      "the ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I\n",
      "found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham’s knee, taking up some stitches\n",
      "in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and\n",
      "of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old\n",
      "banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella\n",
      "and I played at cards, as of yore,—only we were skilful now, and played\n",
      "French games,—and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first\n",
      "time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to\n",
      "come near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this\n",
      "side of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind\n",
      "the half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the\n",
      "room overhead, in the room beneath,—everywhere. At last, when the night\n",
      "was slow to creep on towards two o’clock, I felt that I absolutely\n",
      "could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I\n",
      "must get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out\n",
      "across the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the\n",
      "outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no\n",
      "sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss\n",
      "Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I\n",
      "followed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase. She\n",
      "carried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken from\n",
      "one of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object by\n",
      "its light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed\n",
      "air of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heard\n",
      "her walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across again\n",
      "into that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the dark\n",
      "both to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some\n",
      "streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. During\n",
      "the whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I\n",
      "heard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaseless\n",
      "low cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between\n",
      "her and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and\n",
      "there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,\n",
      "did Miss Havisham’s manner towards Estella in anywise change, except\n",
      "that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former\n",
      "characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley\n",
      "Drummle’s name upon it; or I would, very gladly.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and\n",
      "when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody’s\n",
      "agreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to\n",
      "order, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which,\n",
      "according to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute’s\n",
      "turn to do that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me\n",
      "while the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost\n",
      "between us, that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when\n",
      "he called upon the company to pledge him to “Estella!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Estella who?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never you mind,” retorted Drummle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Estella of where?” said I. “You are bound to say of where.” Which he\n",
      "was, as a Finch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of Richmond, gentlemen,” said Drummle, putting me out of the question,\n",
      "“and a peerless beauty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Much he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I\n",
      "whispered Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that lady,” said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had\n",
      "been honoured.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Do_ you?” said Drummle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so do I,” I added, with a scarlet face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Do_ you?” said Drummle. “_O_, Lord!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the only retort—except glass or crockery—that the heavy\n",
      "creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it\n",
      "as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place\n",
      "and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourable\n",
      "Finch’s impudence to come down to that Grove,—we always talked about\n",
      "coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of\n",
      "expression,—down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew\n",
      "nothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by\n",
      "that? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew\n",
      "where I was to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,\n",
      "after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The\n",
      "debate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more\n",
      "honourable members told six more, during the discussion, that they\n",
      "believed _they_ knew where _they_ were to be found. However, it was\n",
      "decided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummle\n",
      "would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that\n",
      "he had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret,\n",
      "as a gentleman and a Finch, for “having been betrayed into a warmth\n",
      "which.” Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honour\n",
      "should take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a\n",
      "polite little avowal in Estella’s hand, that she had had the honour of\n",
      "dancing with him several times. This left me no course but to regret\n",
      "that I had been “betrayed into a warmth which,” and on the whole to\n",
      "repudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.\n",
      "Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the\n",
      "Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the\n",
      "promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing\n",
      "rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot\n",
      "adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should\n",
      "show any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far\n",
      "below the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been\n",
      "referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my\n",
      "love for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to\n",
      "that hound. No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had\n",
      "favoured; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind\n",
      "and degree of distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle\n",
      "had begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A\n",
      "little while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed\n",
      "one another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and\n",
      "Estella held him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement,\n",
      "now almost flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him\n",
      "very well, now scarcely remembering who he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,\n",
      "however, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a\n",
      "blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness, which\n",
      "sometimes did him good service,—almost taking the place of\n",
      "concentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching\n",
      "Estella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil\n",
      "himself and drop at the right nick of time.\n",

      "At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls\n",
      "at most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,\n",
      "this blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration\n",
      "on her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the\n",
      "next opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to\n",
      "take her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. I\n",

      "\n",
      "“But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should\n",

      "To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it\n",
      "from her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, “Well! Then, that is\n",

      "Now, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any idea\n",

      "I was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to\n",
      "enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third\n",
      "birthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard’s Inn more than a year,\n",
      "and lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the\n",
      "river.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original\n",
      "relations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my\n",
      "inability to settle to anything,—which I hope arose out of the restless\n",
      "and incomplete tenure on which I held my means,—I had a taste for\n",
      "reading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of\n",
      "Herbert’s was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have\n",
      "brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and\n",
      "had a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping\n",
      "that to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed,\n",
      "I sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud,\n",
      "mud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been\n",
      "driving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the\n",
      "East there were an eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the\n",
      "gusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their\n",
      "roofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of\n",
      "windmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast,\n",
      "of shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these\n",
      "rages of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been\n",
      "the worst of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time,\n",
      "and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so\n",
      "exposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the\n",
      "wind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges\n",
      "of cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed\n",
      "against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked,\n",
      "that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.\n",
      "Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it\n",
      "could not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors\n",
      "open and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out;\n",
      "and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black\n",
      "windows (opening them ever so little was out of the question in the\n",
      "teeth of such wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were\n",
      "blown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were\n",
      "shuddering, and that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being\n",
      "carried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book at\n",
      "eleven o’clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul’s, and all the many\n",
      "church-clocks in the City—some leading, some accompanying, some\n",
      "following—struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind;\n",
      "and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,\n",
      "when I heard a footstep on the stair.\n",
      "\n",
      "What nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the\n",
      "footstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I\n",
      "listened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.\n",
      "Remembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up\n",
      "my reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had\n",
      "stopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is some one down there, is there not?” I called out, looking\n",
      "down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said a voice from the darkness beneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What floor do you want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The top. Mr. Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is my name.—There is nothing the matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing the matter,” returned the voice. And the man came on.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowly\n",
      "within its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its\n",
      "circle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere\n",
      "instant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was\n",
      "strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched\n",
      "and pleased by the sight of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially\n",
      "dressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-grey\n",
      "hair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong\n",
      "on his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to\n",
      "weather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp\n",
      "included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was\n",
      "holding out both his hands to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray what is your business?” I asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My business?” he repeated, pausing. “Ah! Yes. I will explain my\n",
      "business, by your leave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you wish to come in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he replied; “I wish to come in, master.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the\n",
      "sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.\n",
      "I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to\n",
      "respond to it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and,\n",
      "having set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to\n",
      "explain himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked about him with the strangest air,—an air of wondering\n",
      "pleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,—and he\n",
      "pulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head\n",
      "was furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-grey hair grew only on\n",
      "its sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the\n",
      "contrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands\n",
      "to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?” said I, half suspecting him to be mad.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over\n",
      "his head. “It’s disapinting to a man,” he said, in a coarse broken\n",
      "voice, “arter having looked for’ard so distant, and come so fur; but\n",
      "you’re not to blame for that,—neither on us is to blame for that. I’ll\n",
      "speak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his\n",
      "forehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him\n",
      "attentively then, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no one nigh,” said he, looking over his shoulder; “is there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,\n",
      "ask that question?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re a game one,” he returned, shaking his head at me with a\n",
      "deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most\n",
      "exasperating; “I’m glad you’ve grow’d up, a game one! But don’t catch\n",
      "hold of me. You’d be sorry arterwards to have done it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even yet\n",
      "I could not recall a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and\n",
      "the rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the\n",
      "intervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first\n",
      "stood face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my\n",
      "convict more distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair\n",
      "before the fire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to\n",
      "me; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round\n",
      "his head; no need to hug himself with both his arms, and take a\n",
      "shivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition. I\n",
      "knew him before he gave me one of those aids, though, a moment before,\n",
      "I had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands. Not\n",
      "knowing what to do,—for, in my astonishment I had lost my\n",
      "self-possession,—I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them\n",
      "heartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You acted noble, my boy,” said he. “Noble, Pip! And I have never\n",
      "forgot it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, I\n",
      "laid a hand upon his breast and put him away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stay!” said I. “Keep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did\n",
      "when I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by\n",
      "mending your way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not\n",
      "necessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be\n",
      "something good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not\n",
      "repulse you; but surely you must understand that—I—”\n",
      "\n",
      "My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at\n",
      "me, that the words died away on my tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You was a-saying,” he observed, when we had confronted one another in\n",
      "silence, “that surely I must understand. What, surely must I\n",
      "understand?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long\n",
      "ago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have\n",
      "repented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am glad\n",
      "that, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But\n",
      "our ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look\n",
      "weary. Will you drink something before you go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly\n",
      "observant of me, biting a long end of it. “I think,” he answered, still\n",
      "with the end at his mouth and still observant of me, “that I _will_\n",
      "drink (I thank you) afore I go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table near\n",
      "the fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of the\n",
      "bottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rum\n",
      "and water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look\n",
      "at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his\n",
      "neckerchief between his teeth—evidently forgotten—made my hand very\n",
      "difficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him, I saw with\n",
      "amazement that his eyes were full of tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished\n",
      "him gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and\n",
      "felt a touch of reproach. “I hope,” said I, hurriedly putting something\n",
      "into a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, “that you\n",
      "will not think I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of\n",
      "doing it, and I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of\n",
      "his neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and\n",
      "stretched out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew\n",
      "his sleeve across his eyes and forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you living?” I asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in\n",
      "the new world,” said he; “many a thousand mile of stormy water off from\n",
      "this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope you have done well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve done wonderfully well. There’s others went out alonger me as has\n",
      "done well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I’m famous for\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which\n",
      "they were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my\n",
      "mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,” I inquired,\n",
      "“since he undertook that trust?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never set eyes upon him. I warn’t likely to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes. I was a\n",
      "poor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little\n",
      "fortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay\n",
      "them back. You can put them to some other poor boy’s use.” I took out\n",
      "my purse.\n",
      "\n",
      "He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he\n",
      "watched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. They\n",
      "were clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to him.\n",
      "Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them\n",
      "long-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped\n",
      "the ashes into the tray.\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I make so bold,” he said then, with a smile that was like a frown,\n",
      "and with a frown that was like a smile, “as ask you _how_ you have done\n",

      "“How?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with\n",
      "his heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. He put a foot up to the bars,\n",
      "to dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neither\n",
      "looked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only\n",
      "now that I began to tremble.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were without\n",
      "sound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it\n",
      "distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Might a mere warmint ask what property?” said he.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Could I make a guess, I wonder,” said the Convict, “at your income\n",
      "since you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?”\n",
      "\n",
      "With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose\n",
      "out of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking\n",
      "wildly at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Concerning a guardian,” he went on. “There ought to have been some\n",
      "guardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As\n",
      "to the first letter of that lawyer’s name now. Would it be J?”\n",
      "\n",
      "All the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its\n",

      "\n",
      "“Put it,” he resumed, “as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun\n",

      "‘However, you have found me out,’ you says just now. Well! However, did\n",

      "particulars of your address. That person’s name? Why, Wemmick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life. I\n",

      "seemed to be suffocating,—I stood so, looking wildly at him, until I\n",
      "grasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He caught\n",
      "me, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on\n",
      "one knee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and\n",
      "that I shuddered at, very near to mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Pip, dear boy, I’ve made a gentleman on you! It’s me wot has done\n",

      "ever I see you on them misty marshes. ‘Lord strike me dead!’ I says\n",

      "\n",
      "In his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearly\n",
      "fainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one\n",
      "grain of relief I had.\n",
      "\n",

      "I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there\n",
      "to come with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black\n",

      "\n",
      "As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but\n",

      "being as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the\n",
      "lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we\n",
      "examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one\n",
      "there. It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have\n",
      "slipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman’s, and\n",
      "leaving him standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including\n",
      "the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and\n",
      "assuredly no other man was in those chambers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on\n",

      "the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had\n",
      "perceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of the\n",
      "night, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in\n",
      "the Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man\n",
      "who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in\n",
      "the country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the\n",
      "night, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came\n",
      "upstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The night being so bad, sir,” said the watchman, as he gave me back my\n",

      "“What sort of person?”\n",

      "The watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working\n",

      "\n",
      "When I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without\n",

      "appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long\n",
      "I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or\n",
      "even who I was that made it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, the old woman and the niece came in,—the latter with a head\n",

      "at sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had come\n",
      "in the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations\n",
      "were to be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they\n",
      "knocked the furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream\n",

      "tongs, and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the\n",

      "stand by and look at you, dear boy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning\n",
      "slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was\n",
      "chained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his\n",
      "hoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its\n",
      "iron grey hair at the sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mustn’t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;\n",

      "ride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood\n",
      "’uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? No, no.\n",
      "We’ll show ’em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won’t us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with\n",

      "\n",
      "“There’s something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It’s\n",
      "yourn. All I’ve got ain’t mine; it’s yourn. Don’t you be afeerd on it.\n",
      "There’s more where that come from. I’ve come to the old country fur to\n",

      "projects you have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look’ee here, Pip,” said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly\n",
      "altered and subdued manner; “first of all, look’ee here. I forgot\n",
      "myself half a minute ago. What I said was low; that’s what it was; low.\n",
      "Look’ee here, Pip. Look over it. I ain’t a-going to be low.”\n",

      "“First,” I resumed, half groaning, “what precautions can be taken\n",

      "\n",
      "“No, dear boy,” he said, in the same tone as before, “that don’t go\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, but look’ee here,” he persisted. “Dear boy, I ain’t come so fur,\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, dear boy, the danger ain’t so great. Without I was informed\n",
      "agen, the danger ain’t so much to signify. There’s Jaggers, and there’s\n",
      "Wemmick, and there’s you. Who else is there to inform?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?” said\n",
      "I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” he returned, “there ain’t many. Nor yet I don’t intend to\n",
      "advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from\n",
      "Botany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who’s to gain by it? Still,\n",
      "look’ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I\n",

      "\n",
      "“And how long do you remain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long?” said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping\n",
      "his jaw as he stared at me. “I’m not a-going back. I’ve come for good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are you to live?” said I. “What is to be done with you? Where\n",
      "will you be safe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear boy,” he returned, “there’s disguising wigs can be bought for\n",
      "money, and there’s hair powder, and spectacles, and black\n",
      "clothes,—shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what\n",
      "others has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of\n",
      "living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You take it smoothly now,” said I, “but you were very serious last\n",
      "night, when you swore it was Death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so I swear it is Death,” said he, putting his pipe back in his\n",
      "mouth, “and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this,\n",
      "and it’s serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What\n",
      "then, when that’s once done? Here I am. To go back now ’ud be as bad as\n",
      "to stand ground—worse. Besides, Pip, I’m here, because I’ve meant it by\n",
      "you, years and years. As to what I dare, I’m a old bird now, as has\n",
      "dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I’m not\n",
      "afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow. If there’s Death hid inside of it,\n",
      "there is, and let him come out, and I’ll face him, and then I’ll\n",
      "believe in him and not afore. And now let me have a look at my\n",
      "gentleman agen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of\n",
      "admiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet\n",
      "lodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert\n",
      "returned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must be\n",
      "confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I\n",
      "could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with\n",
      "him out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so\n",
      "plain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved\n",
      "his consent to Herbert’s participation until he should have seen him\n",
      "and formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy. “And even then,\n",
      "dear boy,” said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out\n",
      "of his pocket, “we’ll have him on his oath.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about\n",
      "the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to\n",
      "state what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never\n",
      "knew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of\n",
      "having been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his\n",
      "knowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that\n",
      "wise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or\n",
      "charm. On this first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he\n",
      "had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had\n",
      "described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in\n",
      "his solitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he\n",
      "looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next\n",
      "discussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an\n",
      "extraordinary belief in the virtues of “shorts” as a disguise, and had\n",
      "in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him\n",
      "something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable\n",
      "difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a\n",
      "prosperous farmer’s; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,\n",
      "and wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the\n",
      "laundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until\n",
      "his change of dress was made.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my\n",
      "dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not\n",
      "get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to\n",
      "remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account\n",
      "to open the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex\n",
      "Street, the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within\n",
      "hail of my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so\n",
      "fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. I\n",
      "then went from shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to\n",
      "the change in his appearance. This business transacted, I turned my\n",
      "face, on my own account, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his\n",
      "desk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before his\n",
      "fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Pip,” said he, “be careful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will, sir,” I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what\n",
      "I was going to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t commit yourself,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and don’t commit any one.\n",
      "You understand—any one. Don’t tell me anything: I don’t want to know\n",
      "anything; I am not curious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I saw that he knew the man was come.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I merely want, Mr. Jaggers,” said I, “to assure myself that what I\n",
      "have been told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at\n",
      "least I may verify it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers nodded. “But did you say ‘told’ or ‘informed’?” he asked\n",
      "me, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in a\n",
      "listening way at the floor. “Told would seem to imply verbal\n",
      "communication. You can’t have verbal communication with a man in New\n",
      "South Wales, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the\n",
      "benefactor so long unknown to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the man,” said Mr. Jaggers, “in New South Wales.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And only he?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And only he,” said Mr. Jaggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for\n",
      "my mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss\n",
      "Havisham.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As you say, Pip,” returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon me\n",
      "coolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, “I am not at all\n",
      "responsible for that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet it looked so like it, sir,” I pleaded with a downcast heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a particle of evidence, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head\n",
      "and gathering up his skirts. “Take nothing on its looks; take\n",
      "everything on evidence. There’s no better rule.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no more to say,” said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for\n",
      "a little while. “I have verified my information, and there’s an end.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And Magwitch—in New South Wales—having at last disclosed himself,”\n",
      "said Mr. Jaggers, “you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout my\n",
      "communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of\n",
      "fact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of\n",
      "fact. You are quite aware of that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I communicated to Magwitch—in New South Wales—when he first wrote to\n",
      "me—from New South Wales—the caution that he must not expect me ever to\n",
      "deviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him\n",
      "another caution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his\n",
      "letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I\n",
      "cautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all\n",
      "likely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his\n",
      "natural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would be\n",
      "an act of felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the\n",
      "law. I gave Magwitch that caution,” said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at\n",
      "me; “I wrote it to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No doubt,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been informed by Wemmick,” pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking\n",
      "hard at me, “that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from\n",
      "a colonist of the name of Purvis, or—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or Provis,” I suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or Provis—thank you, Pip. Perhaps it _is_ Provis? Perhaps you know\n",
      "it’s Provis?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know it’s Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist\n",
      "of the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on\n",
      "behalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by\n",
      "return of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received\n",
      "the explanation of Magwitch—in New South Wales?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It came through Provis,” I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; “glad to have\n",
      "seen you. In writing by post to Magwitch—in New South Wales—or in\n",
      "communicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention\n",
      "that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to\n",
      "you, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.\n",
      "Good-day, Pip!”\n",
      "\n",
      "We shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I\n",
      "turned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two\n",
      "vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,\n",
      "and to force out of their swollen throats, “O, what a man he is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done\n",
      "nothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found the\n",
      "terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in\n",
      "safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.\n",
      "Whatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) than\n",
      "what he had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him\n",
      "that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The more I dressed\n",
      "him and the better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching\n",
      "fugitive on the marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly\n",
      "referable, no doubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar\n",
      "to me; but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there\n",
      "were still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was\n",
      "Convict in the very grain of the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "The influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and gave\n",
      "him a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the\n",
      "influences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,\n",
      "his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now. In all his ways\n",
      "of sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,—of brooding about in\n",
      "a high-shouldered reluctant style,—of taking out his great horn-handled\n",
      "jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,—of lifting\n",
      "light glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsy\n",
      "pannikins,—of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with it\n",
      "the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to make\n",
      "the most of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, and\n",
      "then swallowing it,—in these ways and a thousand other small nameless\n",
      "instances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,\n",
      "Bondsman, plain as plain could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had\n",
      "conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the\n",
      "effect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon\n",
      "the dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it\n",
      "was most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of\n",
      "pretence, and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head. It\n",
      "was abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut\n",
      "short.\n",
      "\n",
      "Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful\n",
      "mystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his\n",
      "knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head\n",
      "tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit\n",
      "and look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all\n",
      "the crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to\n",
      "start up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of\n",
      "him, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the\n",
      "first agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for\n",
      "me and the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon\n",
      "come back. Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and\n",
      "begin to dress myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave\n",
      "him there with everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a\n",
      "private soldier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those\n",
      "lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and\n",
      "the rain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and\n",
      "hanged on my account, and the consideration that he could be, and the\n",
      "dread that he would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When he\n",
      "was not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged\n",
      "pack of cards of his own,—a game that I never saw before or since, and\n",
      "in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the\n",
      "table,—when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would\n",
      "ask me to read to him,—“Foreign language, dear boy!” While I complied,\n",
      "he, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire\n",
      "surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between\n",
      "the fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb\n",
      "show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary\n",
      "student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was\n",
      "not more wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and\n",
      "recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired me\n",
      "and the fonder he was of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It\n",
      "lasted about five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go\n",
      "out, except when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one\n",
      "evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite\n",
      "worn out,—for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful\n",
      "dreams,—I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,\n",

      "recounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings\n",

      "towards the man who had done so much for me.\n",

      "What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there\n",

      "his return,—on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the\n",
      "moment my revelation was finished,—he had no perception of the\n",
      "possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast\n",
      "that he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support\n",
      "the character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as\n",
      "for himself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,\n",
      "and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite\n",
      "established in his own mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Though, look’ee here, Pip’s comrade,” he said to Herbert, after having\n",
      "discoursed for some time, “I know very well that once since I come\n",
      "back—for half a minute—I’ve been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had\n",
      "been low. But don’t you fret yourself on that score. I ain’t made Pip a\n",
      "gentleman, and Pip ain’t a-going to make you a gentleman, not fur me\n",

      "\n",
      "Herbert said, “Certainly,” but looked as if there were no specific\n",
      "consolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were\n",
      "anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us\n",
      "together, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat\n",
      "late. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and saw\n",
      "him safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, I\n",
      "experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of\n",
      "his arrival.\n",

      "Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs, I\n",
      "had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in\n",
      "bringing him back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a\n",
      "large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is\n",
      "conscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that\n",
      "any of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who\n",
      "were passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty\n",
      "when I turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate\n",
      "with us, nobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the\n",
      "fountain, I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and,\n",
      "when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I\n",
      "lived, before going up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and\n",
      "lifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so\n",
      "blessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound\n",
      "words of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the\n",
      "question, What was to be done?\n",
      "\n",
      "The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had\n",
      "stood,—for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in\n",
      "one unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with\n",
      "his pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,\n",
      "and what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,—I say his\n",
      "chair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but\n",
      "next moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had\n",
      "no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my\n",
      "patron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that\n",
      "confidence without shaping a syllable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What,” said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,—“what is\n",
      "to be done?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My poor dear Handel,” he replied, holding his head, “I am too stunned\n",
      "to think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be\n",
      "done. He is intent upon various new expenses,—horses, and carriages,\n",
      "and lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean that you can’t accept—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can I?” I interposed, as Herbert paused. “Think of him! Look at\n",
      "him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to\n",
      "me, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My poor dear Handel,” Herbert repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then,” said I, “after all, stopping short here, never taking another\n",
      "penny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily\n",
      "in debt,—very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,—and I have\n",
      "been bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well, well!” Herbert remonstrated. “Don’t say fit for nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that\n",
      "is, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but\n",
      "for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a\n",
      "warm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anyhow, my dear Handel,” said he presently, “soldiering won’t do. If\n",
      "you were to renounce this patronage and these favours, I suppose you\n",
      "would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have\n",
      "already had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!\n",
      "Besides, it’s absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker’s\n",
      "house, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there is another question,” said Herbert. “This is an ignorant,\n",
      "determined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he\n",
      "seems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce\n",
      "character.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know he is,” I returned. “Let me tell you what evidence I have seen\n",
      "of it.” And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of\n",
      "that encounter with the other convict.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See, then,” said Herbert; “think of this! He comes here at the peril\n",
      "of his life, for the realisation of his fixed idea. In the moment of\n",
      "realisation, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from\n",
      "under his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.\n",
      "Do you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night\n",
      "of his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his\n",
      "putting himself in the way of being taken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you may rely upon it,” said Herbert, “that there would be great\n",
      "danger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he\n",
      "remains in England, and that would be his reckless course if you\n",
      "forsook him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon me\n",
      "from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard\n",
      "myself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my\n",
      "chair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that\n",
      "even if Provis were recognised and taken, in spite of himself, I should\n",
      "be wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so\n",
      "wretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would\n",
      "far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I\n",
      "would ever have come to this!\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first and the main thing to be done,” said Herbert, “is to get him\n",
      "out of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may be\n",
      "induced to go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next\n",
      "street, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to\n",
      "him and making him reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get\n",
      "him away could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything\n",
      "else in his life, now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, again!” said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands\n",
      "held out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. “I know\n",
      "nothing of his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night\n",
      "and see him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes,\n",
      "and yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified\n",
      "me two days in my childhood!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and\n",
      "fro together, studying the carpet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Handel,” said Herbert, stopping, “you feel convinced that you can take\n",
      "no further benefits from him; do you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you feel convinced that you must break with him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Herbert, can you ask me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he\n",
      "has risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from\n",
      "throwing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stir\n",
      "a finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in\n",
      "Heaven’s name, and we’ll see it out together, dear old boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,\n",
      "with only that done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Herbert,” said I, “with reference to gaining some knowledge of\n",
      "his history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him point\n",
      "blank.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. Ask him,” said Herbert, “when we sit at breakfast in the\n",
      "morning.” For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would\n",
      "come to breakfast with us.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams\n",
      "concerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear\n",
      "which I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned\n",
      "transport. Waking, I never lost that fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and sat\n",
      "down to his meal. He was full of plans “for his gentleman’s coming out\n",
      "strong, and like a gentleman,” and urged me to begin speedily upon the\n",
      "pocket-book which he had left in my possession. He considered the\n",
      "chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to\n",
      "look out at once for a “fashionable crib” near Hyde Park, in which he\n",
      "could have “a shake-down.” When he had made an end of his breakfast,\n",
      "and was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of\n",
      "preface,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that\n",
      "the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You\n",
      "remember?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remember!” said he. “I think so!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We want to know something about that man—and about you. It is strange\n",
      "to know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to\n",
      "tell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing\n",
      "more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” he said, after consideration. “You’re on your oath, you know,\n",
      "Pip’s comrade?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Assuredly,” replied Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to anything I say, you know,” he insisted. “The oath applies to\n",
      "all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand it to do so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And look’ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,” he\n",
      "insisted again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So be it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,\n",
      "when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think\n",
      "it might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again,\n",
      "stuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each\n",
      "knee, and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent\n",
      "moments, looked round at us and said what follows.\n",

      "absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his\n",

      "Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his\n",
      "great-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so\n",
      "exasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the\n",
      "robber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat\n",
      "him on the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief\n",
      "came, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well\n",
      "squared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our\n",
      "hands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in\n",
      "the drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle’s\n",
      "was cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both\n",
      "stood our ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you been to the Grove since?” said Drummle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said I, “I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was\n",
      "there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was that when we had a difference of opinion?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” I replied, very shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, come! They let you off easily enough,” sneered Drummle. “You\n",
      "shouldn’t have lost your temper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Drummle,” said I, “you are not competent to give advice on that\n",
      "subject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that\n",
      "occasion), I don’t throw glasses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do,” said Drummle.\n",
      "\n",
      "After glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of\n",
      "smouldering ferocity, I said,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don’t think it an\n",
      "agreeable one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure it’s not,” said he, superciliously over his shoulder; “I\n",
      "don’t think anything about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And therefore,” I went on, “with your leave, I will suggest that we\n",
      "hold no kind of communication in future.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite my opinion,” said Drummle, “and what I should have suggested\n",
      "myself, or done—more likely—without suggesting. But don’t lose your\n",
      "temper. Haven’t you lost enough without that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean, sir?”\n",
      "\n",

      "The waiter reappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don’t\n",
      "ride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady’s?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so, sir!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his\n",
      "hand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,\n",
      "careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket\n",
      "and bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and\n",
      "boiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without\n",
      "introducing Estella’s name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;\n",
      "and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were\n",
      "no one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have\n",
      "remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but for\n",
      "the incursion of three thriving farmers—laid on by the waiter, I\n",
      "think—who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and\n",
      "rubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we\n",
      "were obliged to give way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw him through the window, seizing his horse’s mane, and mounting in\n",
      "his blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought\n",
      "he was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in\n",
      "his mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-coloured dress\n",
      "appeared with what was wanted,—I could not have said from where:\n",
      "whether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,—and as Drummle\n",
      "leaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a\n",
      "jerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching\n",
      "shoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me\n",
      "reminded me of Orlick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or\n",
      "no, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the\n",
      "journey from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house\n",

      "In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles\n",
      "burnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham\n",
      "seated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.\n",
      "Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both\n",
      "raised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I\n",
      "derived that, from the look they interchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what wind,” said Miss Havisham, “blows you here, Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.\n",
      "Estella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and\n",
      "then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as\n",
      "plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived\n",
      "I had discovered my real benefactor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Havisham,” said I, “I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to\n",

      "Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,\n",
      "I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her\n",
      "occupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural\n",
      "place for me, that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,\n",
      "presently—in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not\n",
      "displease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the\n",
      "action of Estella’s fingers as they worked that she attended to what I\n",
      "said; but she did not look up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,\n",
      "and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,\n",
      "anything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not\n",
      "my secret, but another’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to\n",
      "go on, Miss Havisham repeated, “It is not your secret, but another’s.\n",

      "\n",
      "“When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I\n",
      "belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, I\n",
      "suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have\n",
      "come,—as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid\n",
      "for it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, Pip,” replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; “you did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that Mr. Jaggers—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Jaggers,” said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, “had\n",
      "nothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and\n",
      "his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same\n",
      "relation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that\n",
      "as it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no\n",
      "suppression or evasion so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least\n",

      "flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in\n",
      "surprise,—“who am I, for God’s sake, that I should be kind?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I\n",
      "told her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well, well!” she said. “What else?”\n",

      "“I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,” I said, to soothe\n",
      "her, “in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for\n",
      "my own information. What follows has another (and I hope more\n",
      "disinterested) purpose. In humouring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you\n",
      "punished—practised on—perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses\n",
      "your intention, without offence—your self-seeking relations?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my\n",
      "history, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you\n",
      "not to have it so! You made your own snares. _I_ never made them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Waiting until she was quiet again,—for this, too, flashed out of her in\n",
      "a wild and sudden way,—I went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,\n",
      "and have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them\n",
      "to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be\n",
      "false and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you\n",
      "or no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that\n",
      "you deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you\n",
      "suppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and\n",
      "incapable of anything designing or mean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are your friends,” said Miss Havisham.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They made themselves my friends,” said I, “when they supposed me to\n",

      "Mistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do\n",
      "them good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and\n",
      "then said quietly,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you want for them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only,” said I, “that you would not confound them with the others. They\n",
      "may be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same\n",
      "nature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you want for them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not so cunning, you see,” I said, in answer, conscious that I\n",
      "reddened a little, “as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,\n",
      "that I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money\n",
      "to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the\n",
      "nature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you\n",
      "how.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why must it be done without his knowledge?” she asked, settling her\n",
      "hands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because,” said I, “I began the service myself, more than two years\n",
      "ago, without his knowledge, and I don’t want to be betrayed. Why I fail\n",
      "in my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the\n",
      "secret which is another person’s and not mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.\n",
      "After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of\n",
      "the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by the\n",
      "collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again—at\n",
      "first, vacantly—then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All\n",
      "this time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her\n",
      "attention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in\n",
      "our dialogue,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What else?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Estella,” said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my\n",
      "trembling voice, “you know I love you. You know that I have loved you\n",
      "long and dearly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her\n",
      "fingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved\n",
      "countenance. I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from\n",
      "her to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me\n",
      "to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought\n",
      "you could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it.\n",
      "But I must say it now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Preserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,\n",
      "Estella shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know,” said I, in answer to that action,—“I know. I have no hope\n",
      "that I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become\n",
      "of me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love\n",
      "you. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook\n",
      "her head again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise\n",
      "on the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all\n",
      "these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected\n",
      "on the gravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that,\n",
      "in the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she\n",
      "sat looking by turns at Estella and at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It seems,” said Estella, very calmly, “that there are sentiments,\n",
      "fancies,—I don’t know how to call them,—which I am not able to\n",
      "comprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form\n",
      "of words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch\n",
      "nothing there. I don’t care for what you say at all. I have tried to\n",
      "warn you of this; now, have I not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said in a miserable manner, “Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.\n",
      "Now, did you not think so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and\n",
      "beautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is in _my_ nature,” she returned. And then she added, with a stress\n",
      "upon the words, “It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great\n",
      "difference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can\n",
      "do no more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it not true,” said I, “that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and\n",
      "pursuing you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is quite true,” she replied, referring to him with the indifference\n",
      "of utter contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with\n",
      "you this very day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,\n",
      "“Quite true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You cannot love him, Estella!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,\n",
      "“What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do\n",
      "not mean what I say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You would never marry him, Estella?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her\n",
      "work in her hands. Then she said, “Why not tell you the truth? I am\n",
      "going to be married to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better\n",
      "than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear\n",
      "her say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a\n",
      "ghastly look upon Miss Havisham’s, that it impressed me, even in my\n",
      "passionate hurry and grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this\n",
      "fatal step. Put me aside for ever,—you have done so, I well know,—but\n",
      "bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham\n",
      "gives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done\n",
      "to the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly\n",
      "love you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as\n",
      "dearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can\n",
      "bear it better, for your sake!”\n",
      "\n",
      "My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have\n",
      "been touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all\n",
      "intelligible to her own mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going,” she said again, in a gentler voice, “to be married to\n",
      "him. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be\n",
      "married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by\n",
      "adoption? It is my own act.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On whom should I fling myself away?” she retorted, with a smile.\n",
      "“Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if\n",
      "people do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is\n",
      "done. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading me\n",
      "into what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me\n",
      "wait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which\n",
      "has very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say\n",
      "no more. We shall never understand each other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!” I urged, in despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be afraid of my being a blessing to him,” said Estella; “I shall\n",
      "not be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary\n",
      "boy—or man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Estella!” I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do\n",
      "what I would to restrain them; “even if I remained in England and could\n",
      "hold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle’s wife?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense,” she returned,—“nonsense. This will pass in no time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never, Estella!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You\n",
      "have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the\n",
      "rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been\n",
      "in every prospect I have ever seen since,—on the river, on the sails of\n",
      "the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the\n",
      "darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You\n",
      "have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever\n",
      "become acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London\n",
      "buildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be\n",
      "displaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to\n",
      "me, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my\n",

      "moments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,—and soon\n",
      "afterwards with stronger reason,—that while Estella looked at me merely\n",
      "with incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand\n",

      "come to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the\n",

      "close by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till\n",

      "Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made\n",
      "the best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney\n",
      "chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed\n",
      "was always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the\n",
      "chamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next\n",
      "in order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in\n",
      "order on his list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the\n",
      "back, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling\n",
      "over the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the\n",

      "As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,\n",

      "instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever\n",
      "be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the\n",
      "bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a\n",
      "staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and\n",
      "lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more\n",
      "close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.\n",

      "What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an\n",

      "looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a\n",
      "number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers’, and earwigs from the\n",
      "market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying\n",
      "by for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever\n",
      "tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,—a\n",
      "disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable\n",
      "approaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those\n",
      "extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves\n",
      "audible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little\n",
      "washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the\n",
      "chest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired\n",

      "Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never\n",
      "warded off this DON’T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I\n",
      "thought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had\n",
      "read in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums\n",
      "in the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had\n",
      "been found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that\n",
      "he must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to\n",
      "assure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door\n",
      "to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship\n",
      "of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But\n",
      "all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,\n",
      "and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were\n",
      "questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed\n",
      "there could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I\n",
      "thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I\n",
      "recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and\n",
      "tones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,—even then I was\n",
      "pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don’t go home.\n",
      "When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a\n",
      "vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present\n",
      "tense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do\n",
      "not ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may\n",
      "not and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and\n",
      "should not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and\n",

      "I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was\n",
      "plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally\n",
      "plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could\n",
      "be taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had\n",

      "\n",
      "I thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse\n",

      "\n",
      "“Now, Mr. Pip, you know,” said Wemmick, “you and I understand one\n",
      "another. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have\n",
      "been engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official\n",
      "sentiments are one thing. We are extra official.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted\n",
      "the Aged’s sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “being in a\n",

      "well not to mention names when avoidable—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much better not,” said I. “I understand you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “that a\n",
      "certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not\n",
      "unpossessed of portable property,—I don’t know who it may really be,—we\n",
      "won’t name this person—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not necessary,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good\n",
      "many people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,\n",
      "and not quite irrespective of the government expense—”\n",
      "\n",
      "In watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged’s sausage,\n",
      "and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick’s; for which\n",
      "I apologised.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of\n",
      "thereabouts. From which,” said Wemmick, “conjectures had been raised\n",
      "and theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden\n",
      "Court, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By whom?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wouldn’t go into that,” said Wemmick, evasively, “it might clash\n",
      "with official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard\n",
      "other curious things in the same place. I don’t tell it you on\n",
      "information received. I heard it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set\n",
      "forth the Aged’s breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing\n",
      "it before him, he went into the Aged’s room with a clean white cloth,\n",
      "and tied the same under the old gentleman’s chin, and propped him up,\n",
      "and put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then\n",
      "he placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, “All\n",
      "right, ain’t you, Aged P.?” To which the cheerful Aged replied, “All\n",
      "right, John, my boy, all right!” As there seemed to be a tacit\n",
      "understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was\n",
      "therefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in\n",
      "complete ignorance of these proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to\n",
      "suspect),” I said to Wemmick when he came back, “is inseparable from\n",
      "the person to whom you have adverted; is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wemmick looked very serious. “I couldn’t undertake to say that, of my\n",
      "own knowledge. I mean, I couldn’t undertake to say it was at first. But\n",
      "it either is, or it will be, or it’s in great danger of being.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying\n",
      "as much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out\n",
      "of his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I\n",
      "told him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to\n",
      "ask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he\n",
      "deemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his\n",
      "breakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his\n",
      "notion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me\n",
      "once, to put my question.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is\n",
      "Compeyson?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered with one other nod.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he living?”\n",
      "\n",
      "One other nod.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he in London?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave\n",
      "me one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said Wemmick, “questioning being over,” which he emphasised and\n",
      "repeated for my guidance, “I come to what I did, after hearing what I\n",
      "heard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to\n",
      "Clarriker’s to find Mr. Herbert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And him you found?” said I, with great anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any\n",
      "details, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody—Tom,\n",
      "Jack, or Richard—being about the chambers, or about the immediate\n",
      "neighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way\n",
      "while you were out of the way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He would be greatly puzzled what to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He _was_ puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my\n",
      "opinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too\n",
      "far out of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I’ll tell you something. Under\n",
      "existing circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you\n",
      "are once in it. Don’t break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things\n",
      "slacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had\n",
      "done?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Herbert,” said Wemmick, “after being all of a heap for half an\n",
      "hour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is\n",
      "courting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden\n",
      "Pa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a\n",
      "bow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You\n",
      "are acquainted with the young lady, most probably?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not personally,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion\n",
      "who did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to\n",
      "present me to her, she had received the proposal with such very\n",
      "moderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the\n",
      "state of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time\n",
      "before I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert’s\n",
      "prospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful\n",
      "philosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not\n",
      "been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;\n",
      "and thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara’s esteem,\n",
      "and although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged\n",
      "messages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her. However, I\n",
      "did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The house with the bow-window,” said Wemmick, “being by the\n",
      "river-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and\n",
      "being kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished\n",
      "upper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that\n",
      "as a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very\n",
      "well of it, for three reasons I’ll give you. That is to say: _Firstly_.\n",
      "It’s altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual\n",
      "heap of streets great and small. _Secondly_. Without going near it\n",
      "yourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard,\n",
      "through Mr. Herbert. _Thirdly_. After a while and when it might be\n",
      "prudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a\n",
      "foreign packet-boat, there he is—ready.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and\n",
      "again, and begged him to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will,\n",
      "and by nine o’clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or\n",
      "Richard,—whichever it may be,—you and I don’t want to know,—quite\n",
      "successfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he was\n",
      "summoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road and\n",
      "cornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, that\n",
      "it was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself\n",
      "about your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off\n",
      "and quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it;\n",
      "and for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last\n",
      "night, you should not go home. It brings in more confusion, and you\n",
      "want confusion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, and\n",
      "began to get his coat on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now, Mr. Pip,” said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, “I\n",
      "have probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,—from a\n",
      "Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal\n",
      "capacity,—I shall be glad to do it. Here’s the address. There can be no\n",
      "harm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is\n",
      "well with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,—which is another\n",
      "reason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone\n",
      "home, don’t go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip”;\n",
      "his hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; “and let\n",
      "me finally impress one important point upon you.” He laid his hands\n",
      "upon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: “Avail yourself of\n",
      "this evening to lay hold of his portable property. You don’t know what\n",
      "may happen to him. Don’t let anything happen to the portable property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I\n",
      "forbore to try.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Time’s up,” said Wemmick, “and I must be off. If you had nothing more\n",
      "pressing to do than to keep here till dark, that’s what I should\n",
      "advise. You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a\n",
      "perfectly quiet day with the Aged,—he’ll be up presently,—and a little\n",
      "bit of—you remember the pig?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well; and a little bit of _him_. That sausage you toasted was his, and\n",
      "he was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for old\n",
      "acquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!” in a cheery shout.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, John; all right, my boy!” piped the old man from within.\n",
      "\n",
      "I soon fell asleep before Wemmick’s fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed\n",

      "nurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the\n",
      "motherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated with\n",
      "equal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that\n",
      "nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by\n",
      "reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject\n",

      "in with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the\n",
      "basket, and presented, blushing, as “Clara.” She really was a most\n",
      "charming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that\n",
      "truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look here,” said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate\n",
      "and tender smile, after we had talked a little; “here’s poor Clara’s\n",
      "supper, served out every night. Here’s her allowance of bread, and\n",
      "here’s her slice of cheese, and here’s her rum,—which I drink. This is\n",
      "Mr. Barley’s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two\n",
      "mutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two\n",
      "ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It’s\n",
      "stewed up together, and taken hot, and it’s a nice thing for the gout,\n",
      "I should think!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something so natural and winning in Clara’s resigned way of\n",
      "looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and\n",
      "something so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of\n",
      "yielding herself to Herbert’s embracing arm; and something so gentle in\n",
      "her, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks’s Basin,\n",
      "and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the\n",
      "beam,—that I would not have undone the engagement between her and\n",
      "Herbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the\n",
      "growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was\n",
      "heard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it\n",
      "through the ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert,\n",
      "“Papa wants me, darling!” and ran away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is an unconscionable old shark for you!” said Herbert. “What do\n",

      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” said I. “Something to drink?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s it!” cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary\n",
      "merit. “He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.\n",
      "Wait a moment, and you’ll hear Clara lift him up to take some. There he\n",
      "goes!” Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. “Now,” said\n",
      "Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence, “he’s drinking. Now,” said\n",
      "Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, “he’s down again\n",
      "on his back!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to\n",
      "see our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley’s door, he was heard hoarsely\n",
      "muttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the\n",
      "following Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something\n",
      "quite the reverse:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here’s old Bill Barley. Here’s old Bill Barley,\n",
      "bless your eyes. Here’s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the\n",
      "Lord. Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,\n",
      "here’s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley\n",
      "would commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, while\n",
      "it was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which\n",
      "was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and\n",
      "airy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found\n",
      "Provis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to feel\n",
      "none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was\n",
      "softened,—indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never\n",
      "afterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opportunity that the day’s rest had given me for reflection had\n",
      "resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting\n",
      "Compeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man might\n",
      "otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own\n",
      "destruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his\n",
      "fire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick’s judgment\n",
      "and sources of information?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, ay, dear boy!” he answered, with a grave nod, “Jaggers knows.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, I have talked with Wemmick,” said I, “and have come to tell you\n",
      "what caution he gave me and what advice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told\n",
      "him how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or\n",
      "prisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that\n",
      "my chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping\n",
      "close for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had\n",
      "said about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time\n",
      "came, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might\n",
      "be safest in Wemmick’s judgment. What was to follow that I did not\n",
      "touch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it\n",
      "in my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in\n",
      "declared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by\n",
      "enlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled\n",
      "and difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it\n",
      "were no worse?\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His\n",
      "coming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a\n",
      "venture. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had\n",
      "very little fear of his safety with such good help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that\n",
      "something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick’s\n",
      "suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. “We are both good\n",
      "watermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the\n",
      "right time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no\n",
      "boatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance\n",
      "is worth saving. Never mind the season; don’t you think it might be a\n",
      "good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs,\n",
      "and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into\n",
      "that habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,\n",
      "and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or\n",
      "fifty-first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed that\n",
      "it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never\n",
      "recognise us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank.\n",
      "But we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part\n",
      "of his window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was\n",
      "right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;\n",
      "remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and\n",
      "that I would take half an hour’s start of him. “I don’t like to leave\n",
      "you here,” I said to Provis, “though I cannot doubt your being safer\n",
      "here than near me. Good-bye!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear boy,” he answered, clasping my hands, “I don’t know when we may\n",
      "meet again, and I don’t like good-bye. Say good-night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time\n",
      "comes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good-night, good-night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms; and we left\n",
      "him on the landing outside his door, holding a light over the\n",
      "stair-rail to light us downstairs. Looking back at him, I thought of\n",
      "the first night of his return, when our positions were reversed, and\n",
      "when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at\n",
      "parting from him as it was now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no\n",
      "appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the\n",
      "foot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name\n",
      "of Provis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr.\n",
      "Campbell. He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there\n",
      "was, that he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a\n",
      "strong personal interest in his being well cared for, and living a\n",
      "secluded life. So, when we went into the parlour where Mrs. Whimple and\n",
      "Clara were seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr.\n",
      "Campbell, but kept it to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of\n",
      "the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a\n",
      "little affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk\n",
      "had grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the\n",
      "hills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were\n",
      "redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks’s Basin to fill it\n",
      "to overflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and\n",
      "went home very sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The\n",
      "windows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark\n",
      "and still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the\n",
      "fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between\n",
      "me and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my bedside\n",
      "when he came in,—for I went straight to bed, dispirited and\n",
      "fatigued,—made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,\n",
      "he looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as\n",
      "solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat\n",
      "was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her\n",
      "within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and\n",
      "practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in\n",
      "cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been\n",
      "out a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the\n",
      "hours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old\n",
      "London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there\n",
      "was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But\n",
      "I knew well enough how to ‘shoot’ the bridge after seeing it done, and\n",
      "so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to\n",
      "Erith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were\n",
      "pulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the\n",
      "blind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less\n",
      "frequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single\n",
      "word of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there\n",
      "was cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being\n",
      "watched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning\n",
      "persons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in\n",
      "hiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to\n",
      "stand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down,\n",
      "and to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards\n",
      "Clara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch,\n",
      "and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going\n",

      "Some weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,\n",

      "and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at\n",

      "as I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed\n",
      "for money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the\n",
      "want of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve\n",
      "it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But\n",
      "I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more\n",
      "money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and\n",

      "conviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had\n",

      "Mr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the\n",
      "contrary, had rather partaken of its decline. He had been ominously\n",
      "heard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection\n",

      "brave, and who wouldn’t hear of anybody’s paying taxes, though he was\n",

      "had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had\n",
      "found him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,\n",

      "was he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought,\n",
      "in black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I\n",
      "believed not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no\n",

      "and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and\n",
      "a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the\n",
      "housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over\n",
      "me when I last walked—not alone—in the ruined garden, and through the\n",
      "deserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I\n",
      "saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach\n",
      "window; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like\n",
      "lightning, when I had passed in a carriage—not alone—through a sudden\n",
      "glare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association\n",
      "had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,\n",
      "wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a\n",
      "chance swift from Estella’s name to the fingers with their knitting\n",
      "action, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this\n",
      "woman was Estella’s mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed\n",
      "the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said\n",
      "the subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the\n",
      "wine again, and went on with his dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the\n",
      "room was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands\n",
      "were Estella’s hands, and her eyes were Estella’s eyes, and if she had\n",
      "reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less\n",
      "sure that my conviction was the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,\n",
      "quite as a matter of business,—just as he might have drawn his salary\n",
      "when that came round,—and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of\n",
      "perpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine,\n",
      "his post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office\n",
      "for its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong\n",
      "twin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.\n",
      "\n",
      "We took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping\n",
      "among Mr. Jaggers’s stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right\n",
      "twin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down\n",
      "Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was\n",
      "walking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had\n",
      "evaporated into the evening air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said Wemmick, “that’s over! He’s a wonderful man, without his\n",
      "living likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine\n",
      "with him,—and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wouldn’t say it to anybody but yourself,” he answered. “I know that\n",
      "what is said between you and me goes no further.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham’s adopted daughter, Mrs.\n",
      "Bentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of\n",
      "the Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned\n",
      "Miss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll\n",
      "of the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wemmick,” said I, “do you remember telling me, before I first went to\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers’s private house, to notice that housekeeper?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did I?” he replied. “Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,” he added,\n",
      "suddenly, “I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A wild beast tamed, you called her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what do _you_ call her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s his secret. She has been with him many a long year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in\n",
      "being acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me\n",
      "goes no further.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” Wemmick replied, “I don’t know her story,—that is, I don’t know\n",
      "all of it. But what I do know I’ll tell you. We are in our private and\n",
      "personal capacities, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for\n",
      "murder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I\n",
      "believe had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it\n",
      "was up, as you may suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she was acquitted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Jaggers was for her,” pursued Wemmick, with a look full of\n",
      "meaning, “and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a\n",
      "desperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and\n",
      "he worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to\n",
      "have made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day\n",
      "for many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial\n",
      "where he couldn’t work it himself, sat under counsel, and—every one\n",
      "knew—put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,—a\n",
      "woman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.\n",
      "It was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman\n",
      "in Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick\n",
      "(as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of\n",
      "jealousy. The murdered woman,—more a match for the man, certainly, in\n",
      "point of years—was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had\n",
      "been a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched\n",
      "and torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,\n",
      "there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this\n",
      "woman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure,” said Wemmick,\n",
      "touching me on the sleeve, “that he never dwelt upon the strength of\n",
      "her hands then, though he sometimes does now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner\n",
      "party.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir!” Wemmick went on; “it happened—happened, don’t you\n",
      "see?—that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her\n",
      "apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in\n",
      "particular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully\n",
      "contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a\n",
      "bruise or two about her,—nothing for a tramp,—but the backs of her\n",
      "hands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?\n",
      "Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of\n",
      "brambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not\n",
      "have got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles\n",
      "were actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the\n",
      "fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have\n",
      "been broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little\n",
      "spots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made\n",
      "was this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that\n",
      "she was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the\n",
      "murder, frantically destroyed her child by this man—some three years\n",
      "old—to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:\n",
      "“We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and\n",
      "we show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and\n",
      "you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept\n",
      "all consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have\n",
      "destroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have\n",
      "scratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder\n",
      "of her child; why don’t you? As to this case, if you _will_ have\n",
      "scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted\n",
      "for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented\n",
      "them?” “To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr. Jaggers was altogether too\n",
      "many for the jury, and they gave in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Has she been in his service ever since?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; but not only that,” said Wemmick, “she went into his service\n",
      "immediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since\n",
      "been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was\n",
      "tamed from the beginning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you remember the sex of the child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Said to have been a girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have nothing more to say to me to-night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for\n",
      "my thoughts, though with no relief from the old.\n",

      "waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I\n",
      "went down again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway\n",
      "House, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for\n",
      "I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to\n",

      "\n",
      "The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet\n",
      "echoing courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old\n",
      "monks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong\n",
      "walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables,\n",
      "were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral\n",
      "chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried\n",
      "on avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell\n",
      "of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the\n",
      "rooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high\n",
      "trees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was\n",
      "changed, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "An elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who\n",
      "lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the\n",
      "gate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,\n",
      "and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was\n",
      "not in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing.\n",
      "Looking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on\n",
      "the hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the\n",
      "contemplation of, the ashy fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old\n",
      "chimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There\n",
      "was an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to\n",
      "pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could\n",
      "charge her with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in\n",
      "the progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked\n",
      "fortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in\n",
      "a low voice, “Is it real?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost\n",

      "\n",
      "“Thank you. Thank you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I\n",
      "remarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want,” she said, “to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when\n",
      "you were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But\n",
      "perhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my\n",
      "heart?”\n",
      "\n",
      "When I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous\n",
      "right hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it\n",
      "again before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do\n",

      "so; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed\n",
      "that she was conscious of the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you break off,” she asked then, with her former air of being afraid\n",

      "\n",
      "She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was\n",
      "habitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of\n",
      "forcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her\n",
      "how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how in\n",
      "this I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)\n",
      "involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they\n",
      "were the weighty secrets of another.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "She asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an\n",
      "unwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my\n",
      "voice failed me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and\n",
      "softly laid her forehead on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of\n",
      "disquiet than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of\n",

      "\n",
      "She presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room\n",
      "for the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her\n",
      "pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and\n",

      "evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the\n",

      "again, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the\n",

      "mine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and\n",
      "wept. I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that\n",
      "the relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was\n",
      "not kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.\n",

      "mine.” And then, “Take the pencil and write under my name, ‘I forgive\n",

      "What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving\n",

      "me by a wiser head than my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was\n",
      "seized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter\n",
      "down,—that I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers, and come at the bare truth. I really do not know whether I\n",
      "felt that I did this for Estella’s sake, or whether I was glad to\n",
      "transfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned some\n",
      "rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps\n",
      "the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street\n",
      "that night. Herbert’s representations that, if I did, I should probably\n",
      "be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive’s safety would\n",
      "depend upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding,\n",
      "again and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my\n",
      "hurts looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out\n",
      "together, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left\n",
      "Herbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over\n",
      "the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things\n",
      "straight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers’s room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the\n",
      "outer office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick’s post that morning, I knew\n",
      "what was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick\n",
      "together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to\n",
      "compromise him.\n",
      "\n",
      "My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my\n",
      "shoulders, favoured my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief\n",
      "account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to\n",
      "give him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused\n",
      "our talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the\n",
      "rules of evidence, than it had been before. While I described the\n",
      "disaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.\n",
      "Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the\n",
      "pockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post.\n",
      "The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official\n",
      "proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn’t\n",
      "smell fire at the present moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced\n",
      "Miss Havisham’s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for\n",
      "Herbert. Mr. Jaggers’s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when\n",
      "I handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,\n",
      "with instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that was\n",
      "in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked\n",
      "on at me. “I am sorry, Pip,” said he, as I put the check in my pocket,\n",
      "when he had signed it, “that we do nothing for _you_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me,” I returned, “whether she\n",
      "could do nothing for me, and I told her No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody should know his own business,” said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw\n",
      "Wemmick’s lips form the words “portable property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should _not_ have told her No, if I had been you,” said Mr Jaggers;\n",

      "\n",
      "“Every man’s business,” said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,\n",
      "“is portable property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at\n",
      "heart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to\n",
      "give me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave\n",
      "me all she possessed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did she?” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and\n",
      "then straightening himself. “Hah! I don’t think I should have done so,\n",
      "if I had been Miss Havisham. But _she_ ought to know her own business\n",
      "best.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know more of the history of Miss Havisham’s adopted child than Miss\n",
      "Havisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated “Mother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have seen her mother within these three days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps I know more of Estella’s history than even you do,” said I. “I\n",
      "know her father too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner—he was too\n",
      "self-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being\n",
      "brought to an indefinably attentive stop—assured me that he did not\n",
      "know who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis’s\n",
      "account (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;\n",
      "which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers’s\n",
      "client until some four years later, and when he could have no reason\n",
      "for claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this\n",
      "unconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers’s part before, though I was quite sure\n",
      "of it now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So! You know the young lady’s father, Pip?” said Mr. Jaggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” I replied, “and his name is Provis—from New South Wales.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest\n",
      "start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the\n",
      "sooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the\n",
      "action of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the\n",
      "announcement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just\n",
      "then, lest Mr. Jaggers’s sharpness should detect that there had been\n",
      "some communication unknown to him between us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And on what evidence, Pip,” asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he\n",
      "paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, “does Provis make\n",
      "this claim?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He does not make it,” said I, “and has never made it, and has no\n",
      "knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so\n",
      "unexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket\n",
      "without completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked\n",
      "with stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation\n",
      "that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact\n",
      "knew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look\n",
      "towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been\n",
      "for some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers’s look. When I did at last\n",
      "turn my eyes in Wemmick’s direction, I found that he had unposted his\n",
      "pen, and was intent upon the table before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the\n",
      "table. “What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a\n",
      "passionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and\n",
      "manly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had\n",
      "lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had\n",
      "made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I\n",
      "represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence\n",
      "from him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said\n",
      "that I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted\n",
      "assurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,\n",
      "and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he\n",
      "cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,\n",
      "and that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,\n",
      "whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything\n",
      "else in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and\n",
      "silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to\n",
      "Wemmick, and said, “Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle\n",
      "heart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the\n",
      "innocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business\n",
      "life. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to\n",
      "represent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be\n",
      "more open with me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.\n",
      "Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving\n",
      "crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his\n",
      "employment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something\n",
      "like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s all this?” said Mr. Jaggers. “You with an old father, and you\n",
      "with pleasant and playful ways?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” returned Wemmick. “If I don’t bring ’em here, what does it\n",
      "matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling\n",
      "openly, “this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a bit of it,” returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. “I\n",
      "think you’re another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still\n",
      "distrustful that the other was taking him in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_You_ with a pleasant home?” said Mr. Jaggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since it don’t interfere with business,” returned Wemmick, “let it be\n",
      "so. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn’t wonder if _you_ might be\n",
      "planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of\n",
      "these days, when you’re tired of all this work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and\n",
      "actually drew a sigh. “Pip,” said he, “we won’t talk about ‘poor\n",
      "dreams;’ you know more about such things than I, having much fresher\n",
      "experience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I’ll put a\n",
      "case to you. Mind! I admit nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly\n",
      "said that he admitted nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “put this case. Put the case that a\n",
      "woman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child\n",
      "concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal\n",
      "adviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to\n",
      "the latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put\n",
      "the case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an\n",
      "eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I follow you, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he\n",
      "saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain\n",
      "destruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at\n",
      "a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that\n",
      "he habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,\n",
      "neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing\n",
      "up to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw\n",
      "in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn,\n",
      "to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,—to be\n",
      "prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I follow you, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the\n",
      "heap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make\n",
      "no stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this\n",
      "power: “I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so,\n",
      "you did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you\n",
      "through it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it\n",
      "should be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be\n",
      "produced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring\n",
      "you off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost,\n",
      "your child is still saved.” Put the case that this was done, and that\n",

      "shaken the woman’s intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,\n",
      "she was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be\n",
      "sheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the\n",
      "old, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking\n",
      "out, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend\n",
      "the imaginary case?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That\n",

      "mother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many\n",
      "miles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was\n",
      "still a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case\n",
      "to yourself very carefully.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ask Wemmick to put it to _him_self very carefully.”\n",
      "\n",

      "he would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother’s? I\n",
      "think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was. For\n",
      "the daughter’s? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her\n",
      "parentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to\n",
      "disgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for\n",
      "life. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her\n",
      "the subject of those ‘poor dreams’ which have, at one time or another,\n",
      "been in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you\n",
      "that you had better—and would much sooner when you had thought well of\n",
      "it—chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right\n",

      "\n",
      "I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his\n",
      "lips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.\n",
      "“Now, Wemmick,” said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, “what\n",

      "\n",
      "Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the\n",
      "odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times:\n",
      "with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to\n",
      "say conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional\n",
      "light to the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now\n",
      "inflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and\n",
      "Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest\n",
      "point in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen them on such ill\n",
      "terms; for generally they got on very well indeed together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of\n",
      "Mike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on\n",
      "his sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance\n",
      "within those walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or\n",
      "in that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble\n",
      "(which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest\n",
      "daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this\n",
      "melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially\n",
      "before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike’s eye\n",
      "happened to twinkle with a tear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you about?” demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.\n",
      "“What do you come snivelling here for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did,” said Wemmick. “How dare you? You’re not in a fit state to\n",
      "come here, if you can’t come here without spluttering like a bad pen.\n",
      "What do you mean by it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A man can’t help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,” pleaded Mike.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His what?” demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. “Say that again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now look here my man,” said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and\n",

      "\n",
      "“I have thought it over again and again,” said Herbert, “and I think I\n",

      "good fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and\n",
      "honourable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had thought of him more than once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how much would you tell him, Herbert?”\n",
      "\n",

      "Antwerp,—the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any\n",
      "foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do. I\n",
      "had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the\n",
      "boat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for\n",
      "search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would\n",
      "leave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get\n",
      "down the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot\n",
      "until we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we\n",
      "lay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we\n",
      "made inquiries beforehand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after\n",
      "breakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for\n",
      "Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our\n",
      "thoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign\n",
      "steamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied\n",
      "ourselves that we knew the build and colour of each. We then separated\n",
      "for a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;\n",
      "Herbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do\n",
      "without any hindrance, and when we met again at one o’clock reported it\n",
      "done. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen\n",
      "Startop, and he was more than ready to join.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer;\n",
      "our charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our\n",
      "object, we should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not\n",
      "come home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that\n",
      "he should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he\n",
      "should prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on\n",
      "Wednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the\n",

      "home), and its contents were these:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow\n",
      "night at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,\n",
      "you had better come. If you want information regarding _your uncle\n",
      "Provis_, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time.\n",
      "_You must come alone_. Bring this with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange\n",
      "letter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I\n",
      "must decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would\n",
      "take me down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think of\n",
      "going, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And\n",
      "again, for anything I knew, the proffered information might have some\n",
      "important bearing on the flight itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still\n",
      "have gone. Having hardly any time for consideration,—my watch showing\n",
      "me that the coach started within half an hour,—I resolved to go. I\n",
      "should certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle\n",
      "Provis. That, coming on Wemmick’s letter and the morning’s busy\n",
      "preparation, turned the scale.\n",

      "It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of\n",
      "almost any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this\n",
      "mysterious epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be\n",
      "secret got mechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same\n",
      "mechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling\n",
      "him that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I\n",
      "had decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss\n",
      "Havisham was faring. I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock\n",
      "up the chambers, and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If\n",
      "I had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have\n",
      "missed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out\n",
      "of the yard. I was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in\n",
      "straw, when I came to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it\n",
      "had so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning\n",
      "hurry and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had\n",
      "waited for Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And now\n",
      "I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt\n",
      "whether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider\n",
      "whether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue against\n",
      "ever heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through\n",
      "all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose\n",
      "very few hurried people are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis\n",
      "by name mastered everything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already\n",
      "without knowing it,—if that be reasoning,—in case any harm should\n",
      "befall him through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary\n",
      "to me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside\n",
      "in my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of\n",
      "minor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was\n",
      "preparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she\n",
      "was still very ill, though considered something better.\n",
      "\n",
      "My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I\n",
      "dined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not able\n",
      "to cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for\n",
      "me. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain\n",
      "me with my own story,—of course with the popular feature that\n",

      "\n",
      "“Do you know the young man?” said I.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Does he ever come back to this neighbourhood?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“What man is that?”\n",
      "\n",

      "“Is he ungrateful to no one else?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No doubt he would be, if he could,” returned the landlord, “but he\n",
      "can’t. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does Pumblechook say so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say so!” replied the landlord. “He han’t no call to say so.”\n",

      "“But does he say so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would turn a man’s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of\n",
      "it, sir,” said the landlord.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought, “Yet Joe, dear Joe, _you_ never tell of it. Long-suffering\n",
      "and loving Joe, _you_ never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your appetite’s been touched like by your accident,” said the\n",

      "I had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as\n",
      "through the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe;\n",
      "the meaner he, the nobler Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the\n",
      "fire for an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not\n",
      "from my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened\n",
      "round my neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for\n",
      "the letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it,\n",
      "and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of\n",
      "the coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the\n",

      "was a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large\n",

      "among the piled mountains of cloud.\n",

      "There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A\n",

      "so oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew\n",
      "them well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had\n",

      "\n",
      "The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor\n",

      "the distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old\n",
      "lights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew\n",
      "the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles\n",
      "apart; so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night,\n",
      "there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two\n",
      "bright specks.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand\n",

      "I seemed to have the whole flats to myself.\n",

      "It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was\n",
      "burning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and\n",
      "left, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It\n",
      "lay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the\n",

      "\n",
      "Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,—for the rude\n",
      "path lay through it,—I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened\n",
      "my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,\n",
      "I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken,\n",
      "and how the house—of wood with a tiled roof—would not be proof against\n",
      "the weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and\n",
      "ooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapour of the kiln\n",
      "crept in a ghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I\n",
      "knocked again. No answer still, and I tried the latch.\n",
      "\n",
      "It rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a\n",
      "lighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle\n",
      "bedstead. As there was a loft above, I called, “Is there any one here?”\n",
      "but no voice answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it\n",
      "was past nine, called again, “Is there any one here?” There being still\n",
      "no answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen\n",
      "already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the\n",
      "shelter of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was\n",
      "considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be\n",
      "coming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head\n",
      "to look if the wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken\n",
      "up the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent\n",

      "touches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending\n",
      "over the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,\n",
      "breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and\n",
      "showed me Orlick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whom I had looked for, I don’t know. I had not looked for him. Seeing\n",

      "upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,\n",
      "and dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away\n",
      "from him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms\n",
      "folded on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to\n",

      "of such a death. Estella’s father would believe I had deserted him,\n",
      "would be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,\n",
      "when he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had\n",

      "never know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what I\n",
      "had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed\n",
      "through. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible\n",
      "than death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And so\n",
      "quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn\n",

      "resolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some\n",
      "last poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of\n",

      "slung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and\n",

      "\n",
      "“Wolf!” said he, folding his arms again, “Old Orlick’s a-going to tell\n",

      "Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted\n",

      "Now you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of the\n",

      "would do as he had done in my sister’s case,—make all haste to the\n",
      "town, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My\n",
      "rapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with\n",

      "\n",
      "It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years\n",
      "while he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented\n",

      "my brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons\n",
      "without seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of\n",
      "these images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him\n",

      "He flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an\n",
      "instant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the\n",
      "light on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and\n",
      "Biddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the\n",
      "opposite wall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and\n",
      "forwards. His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever\n",
      "before, as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his\n",
      "sides, and with his eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left.\n",
      "Wild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures\n",
      "that rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand\n",
      "that, unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely\n",
      "perishing out of all human knowledge, he would never have told me what\n",
      "he had told.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed it\n",
      "away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed\n",
      "slowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked\n",
      "at me no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of\n",
      "his hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and\n",
      "swearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw\n",
      "in his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one\n",
      "vain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and\n",
      "struggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I\n",
      "could move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until\n",
      "then unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard\n",
      "responsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the\n",
      "door, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of\n",
      "men, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly\n",
      "out into the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the\n",
      "same place, with my head on some one’s knee. My eyes were fixed on the\n",
      "ladder against the wall, when I came to myself,—had opened on it before\n",
      "my mind saw it,—and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I\n",
      "was in the place where I had lost it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who\n",
      "supported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came\n",
      "between me and it a face. The face of Trabb’s boy!\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think he’s all right!” said Trabb’s boy, in a sober voice; “but\n",
      "ain’t he just pale though!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,\n",
      "and I saw my supporter to be—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Herbert! Great Heaven!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Softly,” said Herbert. “Gently, Handel. Don’t be too eager.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And our old comrade, Startop!” I cried, as he too bent over me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remember what he is going to assist us in,” said Herbert, “and be\n",
      "calm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in\n",
      "my arm. “The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is\n",
      "to-night? How long have I been here?” For, I had a strange and strong\n",
      "misgiving that I had been lying there a long time—a day and a\n",
      "night,—two days and nights,—more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank God!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,” said Herbert. “But\n",
      "you can’t help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can\n",
      "you stand?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes,” said I, “I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing\n",
      "arm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen\n",
      "and inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they\n",
      "tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully\n",
      "replaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain\n",
      "some cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the\n",
      "door of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the\n",
      "quarry on our way back. Trabb’s boy—Trabb’s overgrown young man\n",
      "now—went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come\n",
      "in at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I\n",
      "had last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.\n",
      "The white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as\n",
      "I had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,—which at\n",
      "first he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining\n",
      "quiet,—I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our\n",
      "chambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had\n",
      "met in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was\n",
      "gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the\n",
      "inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His\n",
      "uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an\n",
      "hour’s consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who\n",
      "volunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.\n",
      "Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his\n",
      "uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he\n",
      "resolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the\n",
      "Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,\n",
      "finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham’s, where they lost me.\n",
      "Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when\n",
      "I was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh\n",
      "themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.\n",
      "Among the loungers under the Boar’s archway happened to be Trabb’s\n",
      "Boy,—true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he\n",
      "had no business,—and Trabb’s boy had seen me passing from Miss\n",
      "Havisham’s in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb’s boy became\n",
      "their guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by\n",
      "the town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went\n",
      "along, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought\n",
      "there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis’s\n",
      "safety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be\n",
      "mischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and\n",
      "went on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,\n",
      "endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could\n",
      "hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was\n",
      "while my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I\n",
      "was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,\n",
      "and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our\n",
      "immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it\n",
      "was, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such\n",
      "a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be\n",
      "fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we\n",
      "relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the\n",
      "present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather\n",
      "light of the matter to Trabb’s boy; who, I am convinced, would have\n",
      "been much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his\n",
      "intervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb’s boy was of a\n",
      "malignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it\n",
      "was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody’s\n",
      "expense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed\n",
      "to meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an\n",
      "ill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).\n",
      "\n",
      "Wednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London\n",
      "that night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be\n",
      "clear away before the night’s adventure began to be talked of. Herbert\n",
      "got a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this\n",
      "stuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear\n",
      "its pain on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple,\n",
      "and I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for\n",
      "to-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of\n",
      "itself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the\n",
      "mental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon\n",
      "me that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with\n",
      "such consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.\n",
      "\n",
      "No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from\n",
      "communication with him that day; yet this again increased my\n",
      "restlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing\n",
      "that he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me\n",
      "so. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was\n",
      "something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the\n",
      "fact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days\n",
      "wore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,\n",
      "my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow\n",
      "morning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning\n",
      "head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to\n",
      "high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew\n",
      "in prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a\n",
      "fatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to\n",
      "myself with a start, “Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed,\n",
      "and gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the\n",
      "notion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and\n",
      "the opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed\n",
      "and went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for\n",
      "four-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last\n",
      "self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept\n",
      "soundly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking\n",
      "lights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a\n",
      "marsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was\n",
      "spanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and there\n",
      "at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along the\n",
      "clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the\n",
      "unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn\n",
      "from the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.\n",
      "From me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on\n",
      "the sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the\n",
      "fire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In\n",
      "good time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the\n",

      "It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind\n",
      "blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade. We\n",
      "had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly\n",
      "possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the\n",
      "bag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were\n",
      "questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for\n",
      "it was wholly set on Provis’s safety. I only wondered for the passing\n",
      "moment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered\n",
      "circumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if\n",
      "we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had\n",
      "taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After\n",
      "a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two\n",
      "or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went\n",
      "on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then\n",
      "about high-water,—half-past eight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being\n",
      "with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,\n",
      "and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long\n",
      "reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is\n",
      "broad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and\n",
      "where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we\n",
      "could choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all\n",
      "night. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would\n",
      "start from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at\n",
      "what time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail\n",
      "the first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we\n",
      "should have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each\n",
      "vessel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was\n",
      "so great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in\n",
      "which I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the\n",
      "movement on the river, and the moving river itself,—the road that ran\n",
      "with us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage us\n",
      "on,—freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use\n",
      "in the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends,\n",
      "and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present\n",
      "extent, and watermen’s boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing\n",
      "colliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; but\n",
      "of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part so\n",
      "many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and\n",
      "there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;\n",
      "the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a\n",
      "much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and\n",
      "we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its\n",
      "oyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor’s Gate, and\n",
      "we were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,\n",
      "and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking\n",
      "immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were\n",
      "colliers by the score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off\n",
      "stages on deck, as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up,\n",
      "which were then rattled over the side into barges; here, at her\n",
      "moorings was to-morrow’s steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took good\n",
      "notice; and here to-morrow’s for Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we\n",
      "crossed. And now I, sitting in the stern, could see, with a faster\n",
      "beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he there?” said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his\n",
      "signal?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not well from here; but I think I see it.—Now I see him! Pull both.\n",
      "Easy, Herbert. Oars!”\n",
      "\n",
      "We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,\n",
      "and we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas\n",
      "bag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear boy!” he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took his\n",
      "seat. “Faithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty\n",
      "chain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the\n",
      "moment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood and\n",
      "shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the\n",
      "figure-head of the _John of Sunderland_ making a speech to the winds\n",
      "(as is done by many Johns), and the _Betsy of Yarmouth_ with a firm\n",
      "formality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her\n",
      "head; in and out, hammers going in ship-builders’ yards, saws going at\n",
      "timber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky\n",
      "ships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible\n",
      "sea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent\n",
      "lightermen, in and out,—out at last upon the clearer river, where the\n",
      "ships’ boys might take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled\n",
      "waters with them over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly\n",
      "out to the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had\n",
      "looked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We\n",
      "certainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not\n",
      "either attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by\n",
      "any boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on,\n",
      "or to make her purpose evident. But we held our own without any\n",
      "appearance of molestation.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural\n",
      "part of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he\n",
      "had led accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us.\n",
      "He was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his\n",
      "gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not\n",
      "disposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no\n",
      "notion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted\n",
      "it, but it must come before he troubled himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you knowed, dear boy,” he said to me, “what it is to sit here\n",
      "alonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day\n",
      "betwixt four walls, you’d envy me. But you don’t know what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I know the delights of freedom,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah,” said he, shaking his head gravely. “But you don’t know it equal\n",
      "to me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it\n",
      "equal to me,—but I ain’t a-going to be low.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he\n",
      "should have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected\n",
      "that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the\n",
      "habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I\n",
      "was not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t’other side the world, I\n",
      "was always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for\n",
      "all I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could\n",
      "come, and Magwitch could go, and nobody’s head would be troubled about\n",
      "him. They ain’t so easy concerning me here, dear boy,—wouldn’t be,\n",
      "leastwise, if they knowed where I was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If all goes well,” said I, “you will be perfectly free and safe again\n",
      "within a few hours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” he returned, drawing a long breath, “I hope so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And think so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He dipped his hand in the water over the boat’s gunwale, and said,\n",
      "smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, I s’pose I think so, dear boy. We’d be puzzled to be more quiet\n",
      "and easy-going than we are at present. But—it’s a flowing so soft and\n",
      "pleasant through the water, p’raps, as makes me think it—I was a\n",
      "thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the\n",
      "bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this\n",
      "river what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can’t no more hold their tide\n",
      "than I can hold this. And it’s run through my fingers and gone, you\n",
      "see!” holding up his dripping hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But for your face I should think you were a little despondent,” said\n",
      "I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of\n",
      "that there rippling at the boat’s head making a sort of a Sunday tune.\n",
      "Maybe I’m a growing a trifle old besides.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of\n",
      "face, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of\n",
      "England. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been\n",
      "in constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer\n",
      "into the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he\n",
      "would be safest where he was, and he said. “Do you, dear boy?” and\n",
      "quietly sat down again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the\n",
      "sunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose\n",
      "none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By\n",
      "imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of\n",
      "the nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the\n",
      "muddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend.\n",
      "As our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a\n",
      "boat or two’s length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch\n",
      "the stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a\n",
      "large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And\n",
      "soon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,\n",
      "and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking\n",
      "advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us\n",
      "in a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of\n",
      "the tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and\n",
      "mudbanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive\n",
      "with the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour’s rest\n",
      "proved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery\n",
      "stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about. It\n",
      "was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim\n",
      "horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great\n",
      "floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed\n",
      "stranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round\n",
      "the last low point we had headed; and the last green barge,\n",
      "straw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and some\n",
      "ballast-lighters, shaped like a child’s first rude imitation of a boat,\n",
      "lay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles\n",
      "stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes\n",
      "stuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and red\n",
      "landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stage\n",
      "and an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us was\n",
      "stagnation and mud.\n",
      "\n",
      "We pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder\n",
      "work now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and\n",
      "rowed until the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a\n",
      "little, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on\n",
      "the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into\n",
      "black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were\n",
      "the rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,\n",
      "save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,\n",
      "would not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for\n",
      "clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could\n",
      "find. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for\n",
      "anything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or\n",
      "five dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with\n",
      "her galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.\n",
      "The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and\n",
      "what light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as\n",
      "the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we\n",
      "were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular\n",
      "intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or\n",
      "other of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and\n",
      "there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little\n",
      "creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them\n",
      "nervously. Sometimes, “What was that ripple?” one of us would say in a\n",
      "low voice. Or another, “Is that a boat yonder?” And afterwards we would\n",
      "fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with\n",
      "what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran\n",
      "alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard\n",
      "by. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light\n",
      "to be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I\n",
      "dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good\n",
      "fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various\n",
      "liquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,—“such as\n",
      "they were,” the landlord said. No other company was in the house than\n",
      "the landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the “Jack” of the\n",
      "little causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been\n",
      "low-water mark too.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came\n",
      "ashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all\n",
      "else, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the\n",
      "kitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop\n",
      "were to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as\n",
      "carefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there\n",
      "were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have\n",
      "thought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,\n",
      "notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the\n",
      "Jack—who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes\n",
      "on, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as\n",
      "interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a\n",
      "drowned seaman washed ashore—asked me if we had seen a four-oared\n",
      "galley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she must\n",
      "have gone down then, and yet she “took up too,” when she left there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They must ha’ thought better on’t for some reason or another,” said\n",
      "the Jack, “and gone down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A four-oared galley, did you say?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A four,” said the Jack, “and two sitters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did they come ashore here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I’d ha’ been\n",
      "glad to pison the beer myself,” said the Jack, “or put some rattling\n",
      "physic in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ know why,” said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much\n",
      "mud had washed into his throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He thinks,” said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale\n",
      "eye, who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,—“he thinks they was, what\n",
      "they wasn’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ knows what I thinks,” observed the Jack.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_You_ thinks Custom ’Us, Jack?” said the landlord.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do,” said the Jack.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you’re wrong, Jack.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“AM I!”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in\n",
      "his views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into it,\n",
      "knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on\n",
      "again. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he\n",
      "could afford to do anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,\n",
      "Jack?” asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Done with their buttons?” returned the Jack. “Chucked ’em overboard.\n",
      "Swallered ’em. Sowed ’em, to come up small salad. Done with their\n",
      "buttons!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be cheeky, Jack,” remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and\n",
      "pathetic way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A Custom ’Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons,” said the\n",
      "Jack, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, “when\n",
      "they comes betwixt him and his own light. A four and two sitters don’t\n",
      "go hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and\n",
      "both with and against another, without there being Custom ’Us at the\n",
      "bottom of it.” Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord,\n",
      "having no one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the\n",
      "subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind\n",
      "was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and\n",
      "I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley\n",
      "hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an\n",
      "ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced\n",
      "Provis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop\n",
      "by this time knew the state of the case), and held another council.\n",
      "Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer’s time,\n",
      "which would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off\n",
      "early in the morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we\n",
      "deemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour\n",
      "or so of the steamer’s time, and then to get out in her track, and\n",
      "drift easily with the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into\n",
      "the house and went to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a\n",
      "few hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house\n",
      "(the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled\n",
      "me. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the\n",
      "window. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,\n",
      "as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw\n",
      "two men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at\n",
      "nothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I\n",
      "could discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction\n",
      "of the Nore.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going\n",
      "away. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back\n",
      "of the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder\n",
      "day than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I\n",
      "could see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I\n",
      "soon lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the\n",
      "matter, and fell asleep again.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before\n",
      "breakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our\n",
      "charge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the\n",
      "men belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no\n",
      "thought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,—as, indeed,\n",
      "it might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away\n",
      "together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take\n",
      "us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about\n",
      "noon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he\n",
      "and I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.\n",
      "\n",
      "He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me\n",
      "on the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in\n",
      "danger, not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As\n",
      "we approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place,\n",
      "while I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had\n",
      "passed in the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no\n",
      "boat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were\n",
      "there any signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the\n",
      "tide was high, and there might have been some footprints under water.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I\n",
      "waved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;\n",
      "sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving\n",
      "about to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got\n",
      "aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that\n",
      "time it wanted but ten minutes of one o’clock, and we began to look out\n",
      "for her smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards\n",
      "we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on\n",
      "at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of\n",
      "saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands\n",
      "cordially, and neither Herbert’s eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I\n",
      "saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way\n",
      "ahead of us, and row out into the same track.\n",
      "\n",
      "A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer’s smoke,\n",
      "by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,\n",
      "coming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the\n",
      "tide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to\n",
      "sit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, “Trust to\n",
      "me, dear boy,” and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was\n",
      "very skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and\n",
      "fallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,\n",
      "she kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or\n",
      "two when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and\n",
      "looked at us attentively,—as did all the rowers; the other sitter was\n",
      "wrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some\n",
      "instruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in\n",
      "either boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,\n",
      "and gave me the word “Hamburg,” in a low voice, as we sat face to face.\n",
      "She was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew\n",
      "louder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,\n",
      "when the galley hailed us. I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have a returned Transport there,” said the man who held the lines.\n",
      "“That’s the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,\n",
      "otherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,\n",
      "and you to assist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,\n",
      "he ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke\n",
      "ahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on\n",
      "to our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great\n",
      "confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and\n",
      "heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but\n",
      "felt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw\n",
      "the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner’s shoulder,\n",
      "and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,\n",
      "and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite\n",
      "frantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,\n",
      "lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the\n",
      "shrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that\n",
      "the face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.\n",
      "Still, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white\n",
      "terror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board\n",
      "the steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink\n",
      "from under me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand\n",
      "mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was\n",
      "taken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there;\n",
      "but our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of\n",
      "her steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first\n",
      "distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the\n",
      "galley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong\n",
      "strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and\n",
      "eagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,\n",
      "bearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up\n",
      "his hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and\n",
      "true before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,\n",
      "but not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled\n",
      "at the wrists and ankles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water\n",
      "was resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not\n",
      "understanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had\n",
      "been hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and\n",
      "we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out\n",
      "was kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were\n",
      "gone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern\n",
      "we had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise.\n",
      "Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,—Provis no\n",
      "longer,—who had received some very severe injury in the chest, and a\n",
      "deep cut in the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the\n",
      "steamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to\n",
      "his chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought\n",
      "he had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did\n",
      "not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,\n",
      "but that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify\n",
      "him, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had\n",
      "both gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him\n",
      "(Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep him\n",
      "in it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down\n",
      "fiercely locked in each other’s arms, and that there had been a\n",
      "struggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out,\n",
      "and swum away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told\n",
      "me. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their\n",
      "going overboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I asked this officer’s permission to change the prisoner’s wet\n",
      "clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the\n",
      "public-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take\n",
      "charge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book\n",
      "which had once been in my hands passed into the officer’s. He further\n",
      "gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to\n",
      "accord that grace to my two friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone\n",
      "down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was\n",
      "likeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to\n",
      "be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it\n",
      "took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may\n",
      "have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in\n",
      "various stages of decay.\n",
      "\n",
      "We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then\n",
      "Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and\n",
      "Startop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a\n",
      "doleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch’s side, I felt\n",
      "that that was my place henceforth while he lived.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,\n",
      "wounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man\n",
      "who had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,\n",
      "gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a\n",
      "series of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to\n",
      "Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,\n",
      "and often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm\n",
      "I could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that I\n",
      "could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was\n",
      "unquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,\n",
      "people enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not\n",
      "doubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who had\n",
      "been presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since broken\n",
      "prison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation\n",
      "under a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who\n",

      "\n",
      "As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,\n",
      "and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him how\n",
      "grieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear boy,” he answered, “I’m quite content to take my chance. I’ve\n",
      "seen my boy, and he can be a gentleman without me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "No. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.\n",

      "for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped,\n",
      "to speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had\n",
      "meant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened\n",
      "that there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could\n",
      "give the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his\n",
      "private house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner’s behalf would admit nothing. It was the\n",

      "There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had\n",

      "miles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he\n",
      "was only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still\n",
      "legible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a\n",
      "banking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the\n",
      "designation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of\n",
      "information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.\n",

      "the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was\n",
      "from the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people\n",
      "being always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open,\n",
      "seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I\n",
      "thought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only\n",
      "suppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man,\n",
      "habitually to deceive his own instruments. You don’t blame me, I hope,\n",

      "long time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable\n",
      "property. Dear me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _I_ think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, to be sure,” said Wemmick. “Of course, there can be no objection\n",
      "to your being sorry for him, and I’d put down a five-pound note myself\n",
      "to get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson\n",
      "having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and\n",
      "being so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have\n",
      "been saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been\n",
      "saved. That’s the difference between the property and the owner, don’t\n",
      "you see?”\n",

      "I invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass of\n",
      "grog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he\n",
      "was drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up\n",
      "to it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,—\n",

      "Mr. Pip. But if you _could_ oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.\n",
      "It ain’t a long walk, and it’s an early one. Say it might occupy you\n",
      "(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn’t you\n",
      "stretch a point and manage it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little\n",
      "to do for him. I said I could manage it,—would manage it,—and he was so\n",
      "very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his\n",
      "particular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half\n",
      "past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday\n",
      "morning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking\n",
      "tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two\n",
      "glasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have\n",
      "been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his\n",
      "bedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and\n",
      "were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was\n",
      "considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it\n",
      "over his shoulder. “Why, we are not going fishing!” said I. “No,”\n",
      "returned Wemmick, “but I like to walk with one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went\n",
      "towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said\n",
      "suddenly,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halloa! Here’s a church!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather\n",
      "surprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s go in!”\n",
      "\n",
      "We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked\n",
      "all round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets,\n",
      "and getting something out of paper there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halloa!” said he. “Here’s a couple of pair of gloves! Let’s put ’em\n",
      "on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened\n",
      "to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They\n",
      "were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side\n",
      "door, escorting a lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halloa!” said Wemmick. “Here’s Miss Skiffins! Let’s have a wedding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now\n",
      "engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The\n",
      "Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the\n",
      "altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much\n",
      "difficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to\n",
      "put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the\n",
      "pillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old\n",
      "gentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe\n",
      "resistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to\n",
      "perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at\n",
      "those fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without\n",
      "preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out\n",
      "of his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, “Halloa! Here’s a\n",
      "ring!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;\n",
      "while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby’s, made a\n",
      "feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of\n",
      "giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the\n",
      "clergyman’s being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.\n",
      "When he said, “Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?” the\n",
      "old gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we\n",
      "had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.\n",
      "Upon which, the clergyman said again, “WHO giveth this woman to be\n",
      "married to this man?” The old gentleman being still in a state of most\n",
      "estimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed\n",
      "voice, “Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?” To which the Aged replied\n",
      "with great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, “All right, John,\n",
      "all right, my boy!” And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon\n",
      "it, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely\n",
      "married that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church\n",
      "Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it,\n",
      "and put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,\n",
      "put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. “_Now_, Mr.\n",
      "Pip,” said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came\n",
      "out, “let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a\n",
      "wedding-party!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so\n",
      "away upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle\n",
      "board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after\n",
      "the solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer\n",
      "unwound Wemmick’s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in\n",
      "a high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,\n",
      "and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have\n",
      "done.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on\n",
      "table, Wemmick said, “Provided by contract, you know; don’t be afraid\n",
      "of it!” I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the\n",
      "Castle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with\n",
      "him, and wished him joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thankee!” said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. “She’s such a manager of\n",
      "fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for\n",
      "yourself. I say, Mr. Pip!” calling me back, and speaking low. “This is\n",
      "altogether a Walworth sentiment, please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wemmick nodded. “After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may\n",

      "He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his\n",
      "committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken\n",
      "two ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great\n",
      "pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his\n",
      "hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke\n",
      "very little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the\n",
      "first duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he\n",
      "ought to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after\n",
      "the first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities of\n",
      "being with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for his\n",
      "illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a\n",
      "determined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the\n",
      "regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record\n",
      "on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I\n",
      "do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he\n",
      "wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day\n",
      "when the prison door closed upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man\n",
      "who was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner\n",
      "or from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered\n",
      "over the question whether he might have been a better man under better\n",
      "circumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that\n",
      "way, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his\n",
      "desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in\n",
      "attendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his\n",
      "eyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had\n",
      "seen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was\n",
      "a little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I\n",
      "never knew him complain.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be\n",
      "made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions. It\n",
      "was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,\n",
      "and was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the\n",
      "bar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting\n",
      "close to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he\n",
      "stretched forth to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said\n",
      "for him were said,—how he had taken to industrious habits, and had\n",
      "thriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that\n",
      "he had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It\n",
      "was impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him\n",
      "guilty.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible\n",
      "experience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing\n",
      "of Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of\n",
      "Death. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds\n",
      "before me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that\n",
      "I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that\n",

      "it at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and\n",
      "women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and\n",
      "weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There\n",
      "had been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been\n",
      "stilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains\n",
      "and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great\n",
      "gallery full of people,—a large theatrical audience,—looked on, as the\n",
      "two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge\n",
      "addressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must\n",
      "single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had\n",
      "been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments\n",
      "and punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of\n",
      "years; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had\n",
      "made his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable\n",
      "man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when\n",
      "far removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a\n",
      "peaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those\n",
      "propensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered\n",
      "him a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and\n",
      "repentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.\n",
      "Being here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading\n",
      "the officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of\n",
      "flight, he had resisted them, and had—he best knew whether by express\n",
      "design, or in the blindness of his hardihood—caused the death of his\n",
      "denouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment\n",
      "for his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his\n",
      "case being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.\n",

      "The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the\n",
      "glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of\n",
      "light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,\n",
      "and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,\n",
      "with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all\n",
      "things, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face\n",
      "in this way of light, the prisoner said, “My Lord, I have received my\n",
      "sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,” and sat down\n",
      "again. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had\n",
      "to say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of\n",
      "them were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard\n",
      "look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three\n",
      "shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had\n",
      "taken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of\n",
      "having to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held\n",
      "my hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got\n",
      "up (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),\n",
      "and pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him\n",
      "and me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder’s\n",
      "Report was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that\n",
      "night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting\n",
      "forth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my\n",
      "sake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I\n",
      "had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men\n",
      "in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the\n",
      "Crown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took\n",
      "no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed\n",
      "in these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away\n",
      "from the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful\n",
      "and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable\n",
      "restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,\n",
      "wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.\n",
      "To the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold,\n",
      "dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and\n",
      "their long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.\n",
      "\n",
      "The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more\n",
      "strictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an\n",
      "intention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I\n",
      "sat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,\n",
      "that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the\n",
      "singleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There\n",
      "was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer\n",
      "always gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick\n",
      "prisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as\n",
      "sick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be\n",
      "thanked!) always joined in the same report.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly\n",
      "looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face\n",
      "until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would\n",
      "subside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then\n",
      "he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to\n",
      "understand his meaning very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in\n",

      "speak to him, if he can hear me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,\n",

      "determine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put bills\n",
      "up in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and\n",
      "began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought\n",
      "rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and\n",
      "concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth\n",
      "beyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me\n",
      "had enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that\n",

      "inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and\n",
      "groaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my\n",
      "own making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark\n",
      "corner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again,\n",
      "that Miss Havisham was consuming within it,—these were things that I\n",
      "tried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that\n",
      "morning on my bed. But the vapour of a limekiln would come between me\n",
      "and them, disordering them all, and it was through the vapour at last\n",
      "that I saw two men looking at me.\n",

      "\n",
      "I made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended to\n",

      "brick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the\n",
      "giddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a\n",
      "vast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored\n",
      "in my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered\n",
      "off; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own\n",
      "remembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes\n",
      "struggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and\n",
      "that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and\n",
      "would then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me\n",
      "down, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a\n",
      "constant tendency in all these people,—who, when I was very ill, would\n",
      "present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,\n",
      "and would be much dilated in size,—above all, I say, I knew that there\n",

      "After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice\n",
      "that while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature\n",

      "opened my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the\n",
      "bedside, Joe. I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the\n",
      "window-seat, smoking his pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw\n",
      "Joe. I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was\n",
      "Joe’s. I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face that\n",
      "looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, one day, I took courage, and said, “_Is_ it Joe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "And the dear old home-voice answered, “Which it air, old chap.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe. Tell\n",
      "me of my ingratitude. Don’t be so good to me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "For Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side, and\n",
      "put his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe, “you and me was ever friends.\n",
      "And when you’re well enough to go out for a ride—what larks!”\n",
      "\n",
      "After which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his back\n",
      "towards me, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me\n",
      "from getting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering,\n",
      "“O God bless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“How long, dear Joe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Pretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your\n",
      "being ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post,\n",
      "and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal\n",
      "of walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part,\n",
      "and marriage were the great wish of his hart—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you\n",
      "said to Biddy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which it were,” said Joe, “that how you might be amongst strangers,\n",
      "and that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a\n",
      "moment might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, ‘Go\n",
      "to him, without loss of time.’ That,” said Joe, summing up with his\n",
      "judicial air, “were the word of Biddy. ‘Go to him,’ Biddy say, ‘without\n",
      "loss of time.’ In short, I shouldn’t greatly deceive you,” Joe added,\n",
      "after a little grave reflection, “if I represented to you that the word\n",
      "of that young woman were, ‘without a minute’s loss of time.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "There Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked to\n",
      "in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at\n",
      "stated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that\n",
      "I was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay\n",
      "quiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at\n",
      "him, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the\n",
      "pride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its\n",
      "curtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as\n",
      "the airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the\n",
      "room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own\n",
      "writing-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,\n",
      "Joe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the\n",
      "pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his\n",
      "sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was\n",
      "necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,\n",
      "and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin;\n",
      "and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might\n",
      "have been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen\n",
      "spluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on\n",
      "the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into\n",
      "space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was\n",
      "tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he\n",
      "got on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had\n",
      "removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with\n",
      "his two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the\n",
      "effect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,\n",
      "with unbounded satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to\n",
      "talk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He\n",
      "shook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she dead, Joe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why you see, old chap,” said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by\n",
      "way of getting at it by degrees, “I wouldn’t go so far as to say that,\n",
      "for that’s a deal to say; but she ain’t—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Living, Joe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s nigher where it is,” said Joe; “she ain’t living.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did she linger long, Joe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you\n",
      "was put to it) a week,” said Joe; still determined, on my account, to\n",
      "come at everything by degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “it do appear that she had settled the most\n",
      "of it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she had\n",
      "wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the\n",
      "accident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,\n",
      "do you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand\n",
      "unto him? ‘Because of Pip’s account of him, the said Matthew.’ I am\n",
      "told by Biddy, that air the writing,” said Joe, repeating the legal\n",
      "turn as if it did him infinite good, “‘account of him the said\n",
      "Matthew.’ And a cool four thousand, Pip!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature\n",
      "of the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money\n",
      "more to him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being\n",
      "cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I\n",
      "had done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other\n",
      "relations had any legacies?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Sarah,” said Joe, “she have twenty-five pound perannium fur to\n",
      "buy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty\n",
      "pound down. Mrs.—what’s the name of them wild beasts with humps, old\n",
      "chap?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Camels?” said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe nodded. “Mrs. Camels,” by which I presently understood he meant\n",
      "Camilla, “she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in\n",
      "spirits when she wake up in the night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give\n",
      "me great confidence in Joe’s information. “And now,” said Joe, “you\n",
      "ain’t that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one\n",
      "additional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he’s been a bustin’ open a\n",
      "dwelling-ouse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whose?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,” said\n",
      "Joe, apologetically; “still, a Englishman’s ouse is his Castle, and\n",
      "castles must not be busted ’cept when done in war time. And wotsume’er\n",
      "the failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it Pumblechook’s house that has been broken into, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s it, Pip,” said Joe; “and they took his till, and they took his\n",
      "cash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,\n",
      "and they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him\n",
      "up to his bedpust, and they giv’ him a dozen, and they stuffed his\n",
      "mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he\n",
      "knowed Orlick, and Orlick’s in the county jail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow\n",
      "to gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe\n",
      "stayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,\n",
      "that I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me in\n",
      "the old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old\n",
      "unassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my\n",
      "life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles\n",
      "of the fever that was gone. He did everything for me except the\n",
      "household work, for which he had engaged a very decent woman, after\n",
      "paying off the laundress on his first arrival. “Which I do assure you,\n",
      "Pip,” he would often say, in explanation of that liberty; “I found her\n",
      "a tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off the\n",
      "feathers in a bucket, for sale. Which she would have tapped yourn next,\n",
      "and draw’d it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying away\n",
      "the coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the\n",
      "wine and spirits in your Wellington boots.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had\n",
      "once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day\n",
      "came, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,\n",
      "took me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were\n",
      "still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of\n",
      "the wealth of his great nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,\n",
      "where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,\n",
      "and sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be\n",
      "Sunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought how\n",
      "it had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been\n",
      "forming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and\n",
      "by night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning\n",
      "and tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed\n",
      "there came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday\n",
      "bells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I\n",
      "felt that I was not nearly thankful enough,—that I was too weak yet to\n",
      "be even that,—and I laid my head on Joe’s shoulder, as I had laid it\n",
      "long ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too\n",
      "much for my young senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used to\n",
      "talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change\n",
      "whatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my\n",
      "eyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me—so\n",
      "easily!—across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful\n",
      "Christmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet\n",
      "made any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of\n",
      "my late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself\n",
      "now, and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself\n",
      "whether I ought to refer to it when he did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you heard, Joe,” I asked him that evening, upon further\n",
      "consideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, “who my patron\n",
      "was?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heerd,” returned Joe, “as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you hear who it was, Joe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv’ you\n",
      "the bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So it was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Astonishing!” said Joe, in the placidest way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?” I presently asked, with\n",
      "increasing diffidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think,” said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather\n",
      "evasively at the window-seat, “as I _did_ hear tell that how he were\n",
      "something or another in a general way in that direction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not partickler, Pip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you would like to hear, Joe—” I was beginning, when Joe got up and\n",

      "“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe, bending over me. “Ever the best of\n",
      "friends; ain’t us, Pip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was ashamed to answer him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wery good, then,” said Joe, as if I _had_ answered; “that’s all right;\n",
      "that’s agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as\n",
      "betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There’s subjects enough\n",
      "as betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your\n",
      "poor sister and her Rampages! And don’t you remember Tickler?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do indeed, Joe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe. “I done what I could to keep you and\n",
      "Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my\n",
      "inclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it\n",
      "were not so much,” said Joe, in his favourite argumentative way, “that\n",
      "she dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that\n",
      "she dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain’t a\n",
      "grab at a man’s whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your\n",
      "sister was quite welcome), that ’ud put a man off from getting a little\n",
      "child out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into\n",
      "heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up\n",
      "and says to himself, ‘Where is the good as you are a-doing? I grant you\n",
      "I see the ’arm,’ says the man, ‘but I don’t see the good. I call upon\n",
      "you, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The man says?” I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The man says,” Joe assented. “Is he right, that man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Joe, he is always right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “then abide by your words. If he’s always\n",
      "right (which in general he’s more likely wrong), he’s right when he\n",
      "says this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when\n",
      "you was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know’d as J.\n",
      "Gargery’s power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal\n",
      "to his inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two\n",
      "sech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy\n",
      "giv’ herself a deal o’ trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost\n",
      "awful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this\n",
      "light, as I should so put it. Both of which,” said Joe, quite charmed\n",
      "with his logical arrangement, “being done, now this to you a true\n",
      "friend, say. Namely. You mustn’t go a overdoing on it, but you must\n",
      "have your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixt\n",
      "the sheets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact\n",
      "and kindness with which Biddy—who with her woman’s wit had found me out\n",
      "so soon—had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But\n",
      "whether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all\n",
      "dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not\n",
      "understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to\n",
      "develop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension\n",
      "of, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less\n",
      "easy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear\n",
      "fellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,\n",
      "the dear “old Pip, old chap,” that now were music in my ears. I too had\n",
      "fallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,\n",
      "imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe’s hold upon them began\n",
      "to slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to\n",
      "understand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was\n",
      "all mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that\n",
      "in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given\n",
      "Joe’s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got\n",
      "stronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better\n",
      "loosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the\n",
      "Temple Gardens leaning on Joe’s arm, that I saw this change in him very\n",
      "plainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at\n",
      "the river, and I chanced to say as we got up,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back\n",
      "by myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which do not overdo it, Pip,” said Joe; “but I shall be happy fur to\n",
      "see you able, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no\n",
      "further than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker\n",
      "than I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was\n",
      "thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing\n",
      "change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I\n",
      "was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come\n",
      "down to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not\n",
      "quite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little\n",
      "savings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I\n",
      "must not suffer him to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to\n",
      "bed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,—to-morrow being\n",
      "Sunday,—and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday\n",
      "morning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this\n",
      "last vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts\n",
      "(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go\n",
      "out to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I\n",
      "cleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically\n",
      "arrived at a resolution too.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and\n",
      "then walked in the fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear old Pip, old chap, you’re a’most come round, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Likeways for myself, sir,” Joe returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were\n",
      "days once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall\n",
      "forget these.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pip,” said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, “there has\n",
      "been larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us—have been.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done\n",
      "all through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well\n",
      "as in the morning?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, dear Joe, quite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And are always a getting stronger, old chap?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, dear Joe, steadily.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and\n",
      "said, in what I thought a husky voice, “Good night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of\n",
      "my resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before\n",
      "breakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;\n",
      "for, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and\n",
      "he was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These\n",
      "were its brief contents:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear\n",
      "Pip and will do better without\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JO.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“P.S. Ever the best of friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I\n",
      "had been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my\n",
      "creditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be\n",
      "quite recovered. I had never dreamed of Joe’s having paid the money;\n",
      "but Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "What remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and\n",
      "there to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance\n",
      "with him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved\n",
      "Secondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my\n",
      "thoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her how\n",
      "humbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lost\n",
      "all I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences in\n",
      "my first unhappy time. Then I would say to her, “Biddy, I think you\n",
      "once liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed\n",
      "away from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been\n",
      "since. If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take\n",
      "me with all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can\n",
      "receive me like a forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and\n",
      "have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I am\n",
      "a little worthier of you that I was,—not much, but a little. And,\n",
      "Biddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge\n",
      "with Joe, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in\n",
      "this country, or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an\n",
      "opportunity awaits me which I set aside, when it was offered, until I\n",
      "knew your answer. And now, dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will\n",
      "go through the world with me, you will surely make it a better world\n",
      "for me, and me a better man for it, and I will try hard to make it a\n",
      "better world for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to\n",
      "the old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all I\n",
      "have left to tell.\n",

      "\n",
      "The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to\n",
      "my native place and its neighbourhood before I got there. I found the\n",
      "Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a\n",
      "great change in the Boar’s demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivated\n",
      "my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,\n",
      "the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out\n",
      "of property.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so\n",
      "often made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,\n",
      "which was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and\n",
      "could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and\n",
      "post-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as\n",
      "in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and\n",
      "the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled\n",
      "round by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits\n",
      "of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of\n",
      "the Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to\n",
      "be sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in\n",
      "whitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of\n",
      "the main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were\n",
      "marked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn\n",
      "down to make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in\n",
      "the dust and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open\n",
      "gate, and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger\n",
      "who had no business there, I saw the auctioneer’s clerk walking on the\n",
      "casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler,\n",
      "pen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so\n",
      "often pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar’s coffee-room, I found Mr.\n",
      "Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not improved\n",
      "in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and\n",
      "addressed me in the following terms:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be\n",
      "expected! what else could be expected!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I\n",
      "was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, “put a muffin on table.\n",
      "And has it come to this! Has it come to this!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me\n",
      "and poured out my tea—before I could touch the teapot—with the air of a\n",
      "benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, “put the salt on. In\n",
      "happier times,” addressing me, “I think you took sugar? And did you\n",
      "take milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you,” said I, shortly, “but I don’t eat watercresses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t eat ’em,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his\n",
      "head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if\n",
      "abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. “True.\n",
      "The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn’t bring any, William.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand\n",
      "over me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Little more than skin and bone!” mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. “And\n",
      "yet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread\n",
      "afore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner\n",
      "in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, “May I?”\n",
      "and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the\n",
      "same fat five fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” he went on, handing me the bread and butter. “And air you\n",
      "a-going to Joseph?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In heaven’s name,” said I, firing in spite of myself, “what does it\n",
      "matter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook\n",
      "the opportunity he wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, young man,” said he, releasing the handle of the article in\n",
      "question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the\n",
      "behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, “I _will_ leave that\n",
      "teapot alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I\n",
      "forgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to\n",
      "wish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of\n",
      "prodigygality, to be stimilated by the ’olesome nourishment of your\n",
      "forefathers. And yet,” said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and\n",
      "waiter, and pointing me out at arm’s length, “this is him as I ever\n",
      "sported with in his days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I\n",
      "tell you this is him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be\n",
      "particularly affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is him,” said Pumblechook, “as I have rode in my shay-cart. This\n",
      "is him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister\n",
      "of which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M’ria from\n",
      "her own mother, let him deny it if he can!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave\n",
      "the case a black look.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Young man,” said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old\n",
      "fashion, “you air a-going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you ask\n",
      "me, where you air a-going? I say to you, Sir, you air a-going to\n",
      "Joseph.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of\n",
      "saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and\n",
      "conclusive, “I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of\n",
      "the Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is\n",
      "William, which his father’s name was Potkins if I do not deceive\n",
      "myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do not, sir,” said William.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In their presence,” pursued Pumblechook, “I will tell you, young man,\n",
      "what to say to Joseph. Says you, “Joseph, I have this day seen my\n",
      "earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun’s. I will name no\n",
      "names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have\n",

      "\n",
      "“I swear I don’t see him here,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say that likewise,” retorted Pumblechook. “Say you said that, and even\n",
      "Joseph will probably betray surprise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There you quite mistake him,” said I. “I know better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Says you,” Pumblechook went on, “‘Joseph, I have seen that man, and\n",
      "that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your\n",
      "character, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and\n",
      "ignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of\n",
      "gratitoode. Yes, Joseph,’ says you,” here Pumblechook shook his head\n",
      "and hand at me, “‘he knows my total deficiency of common human\n",
      "gratitoode. _He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can. _You_ do not know it,\n",
      "Joseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Windy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face\n",
      "to talk thus to mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Says you, ‘Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now\n",
      "repeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of\n",
      "Providence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it\n",
      "plain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. _Reward of ingratitoode to\n",
      "his earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun’s_. But that man said he\n",
      "did not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to\n",
      "do it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would\n",
      "do it again.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s pity,” said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted\n",

      "again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Squires of the Boar!” Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord,\n",

      "\n",
      "With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,\n",

      "and where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was\n",

      "in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving\n",

      "when it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if\n",

      "The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate\n",
      "was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of\n",
      "their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\n",
      "respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\n",
      "surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single\n",
      "man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his\n",
      "life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her\n",
      "death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\n",
      "alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received\n",
      "into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal\n",
      "inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to\n",
      "bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their\n",
      "children, the old Gentleman’s days were comfortably spent. His\n",
      "attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\n",
      "interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\n",
      "comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\n",
      "children added a relish to his existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\n",
      "lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was\n",
      "amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\n",
      "and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own\n",
      "marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his\n",
      "wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\n",
      "so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\n",
      "of what might arise to them from their father’s inheriting that\n",
      "property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their\n",
      "father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the\n",
      "remaining moiety of his first wife’s fortune was also secured to her\n",
      "child, and he had only a life-interest in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other\n",
      "will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so\n",
      "unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;—but\n",
      "he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\n",
      "bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\n",
      "and daughters than for himself or his son;—but to his son, and his\n",
      "son’s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as\n",
      "to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear\n",
      "to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or\n",
      "by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the\n",
      "benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and\n",
      "mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by\n",
      "such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three\n",
      "years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his\n",
      "own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh\n",
      "all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received\n",
      "from his niece and her daughters. He meant not to be unkind, however,\n",
      "and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a\n",
      "thousand pounds a-piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood’s disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was\n",
      "cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years,\n",
      "and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce\n",
      "of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate\n",
      "improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was\n",
      "his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten\n",
      "thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for\n",
      "his widow and daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.\n",
      "Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness\n",
      "could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the\n",
      "family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at\n",
      "such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make\n",
      "them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\n",
      "and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might\n",
      "prudently be in his power to do for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted\n",
      "and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well\n",
      "respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of\n",
      "his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have\n",
      "been made still more respectable than he was:—he might even have been\n",
      "made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very\n",
      "fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of\n",
      "himself;—more narrow-minded and selfish.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to\n",
      "increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand\n",
      "pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The\n",
      "prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\n",
      "besides the remaining half of his own mother’s fortune, warmed his\n",
      "heart, and made him feel capable of generosity. “Yes, he would give\n",
      "them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would\n",
      "be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he could\n",
      "spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.” He thought of\n",
      "it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner was his father’s funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,\n",
      "without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,\n",
      "arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her\n",
      "right to come; the house was her husband’s from the moment of his\n",
      "father’s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the\n",
      "greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood’s situation, with only common\n",
      "feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;—but in _her_ mind there was\n",
      "a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of\n",
      "the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of\n",
      "immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with\n",
      "any of her husband’s family; but she had had no opportunity, till the\n",
      "present, of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of\n",
      "other people she could act when occasion required it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so\n",
      "earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the\n",
      "arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had\n",
      "not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the\n",
      "propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children\n",
      "determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach\n",
      "with their brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed\n",
      "a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified\n",
      "her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and\n",
      "enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,\n",
      "that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led\n",
      "to imprudence. She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was\n",
      "affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\n",
      "them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which\n",
      "one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne’s abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor’s.\n",
      "She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her\n",
      "joys, could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable, interesting:\n",
      "she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between her and her\n",
      "mother was strikingly great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister’s sensibility; but\n",
      "by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each\n",
      "other now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief which\n",
      "overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, was\n",
      "created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to their\n",
      "sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could\n",
      "afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future.\n",
      "Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she\n",
      "could exert herself. She could consult with her brother, could receive\n",
      "her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;\n",
      "and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion, and encourage\n",
      "her to similar forbearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but\n",
      "as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne’s romance, without\n",
      "having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal\n",
      "her sisters at a more advanced period of life.\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her\n",
      "mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.\n",
      "As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by\n",
      "her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\n",
      "beyond himself, his wife, and their child. He really pressed them, with\n",
      "some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no plan\n",
      "appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could\n",
      "accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his invitation\n",
      "was accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former\n",
      "delight, was exactly what suited her mind. In seasons of cheerfulness,\n",
      "no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater\n",
      "degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness\n",
      "itself. But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\n",
      "and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended\n",
      "to do for his sisters. To take three thousand pounds from the fortune\n",
      "of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most\n",
      "dreadful degree. She begged him to think again on the subject. How\n",
      "could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too,\n",
      "of so large a sum? And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,\n",
      "who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as no\n",
      "relationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount. It\n",
      "was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist\n",
      "between the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he\n",
      "to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his\n",
      "money to his half sisters?\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was my father’s last request to me,” replied her husband, “that I\n",
      "should assist his widow and daughters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he\n",
      "was light-headed at the time. Had he been in his right senses, he could\n",
      "not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your\n",
      "fortune from your own child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only\n",
      "requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their\n",
      "situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. Perhaps it\n",
      "would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. He could\n",
      "hardly suppose I should neglect them. But as he required the promise, I\n",
      "could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time. The\n",
      "promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. Something must be\n",
      "done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, _let_ something be done for them; but _that_ something\n",
      "need not be three thousand pounds. Consider,” she added, “that when the\n",
      "money is once parted with, it never can return. Your sisters will\n",
      "marry, and it will be gone for ever. If, indeed, it could be restored\n",
      "to our poor little boy—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, to be sure,” said her husband, very gravely, “that would make\n",
      "great difference. The time may come when Harry will regret that so\n",
      "large a sum was parted with. If he should have a numerous family, for\n",
      "instance, it would be a very convenient addition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure it would.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were\n",
      "diminished one half.—Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase\n",
      "to their fortunes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! beyond anything great! What brother on earth would do half so much\n",
      "for his sisters, even if _really_ his sisters! And as it is—only half\n",
      "blood!—But you have such a generous spirit!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would not wish to do any thing mean,” he replied. “One had rather,\n",
      "on such occasions, do too much than too little. No one, at least, can\n",
      "think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly\n",
      "expect more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no knowing what _they_ may expect,” said the lady, “but we\n",
      "are not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can\n",
      "afford to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly—and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds\n",
      "a-piece. As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have\n",
      "about three thousand pounds on their mother’s death—a very comfortable\n",
      "fortune for any young woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no\n",
      "addition at all. They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst\n",
      "them. If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do\n",
      "not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten\n",
      "thousand pounds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the\n",
      "whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother\n",
      "while she lives, rather than for them—something of the annuity kind I\n",
      "mean.—My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.\n",
      "A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this\n",
      "plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure,” said she, “it is better than parting with fifteen hundred\n",
      "pounds at once. But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years\n",
      "we shall be completely taken in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that\n",
      "purchase.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when\n",
      "there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy,\n",
      "and hardly forty. An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over\n",
      "and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it. You are not\n",
      "aware of what you are doing. I have known a great deal of the trouble\n",
      "of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to\n",
      "old superannuated servants by my father’s will, and it is amazing how\n",
      "disagreeable she found it. Twice every year these annuities were to be\n",
      "paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then\n",
      "one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be\n",
      "no such thing. My mother was quite sick of it. Her income was not her\n",
      "own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more\n",
      "unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been\n",
      "entirely at my mother’s disposal, without any restriction whatever. It\n",
      "has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would\n",
      "not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is certainly an unpleasant thing,” replied Mr. Dashwood, “to have\n",
      "those kind of yearly drains on one’s income. One’s fortune, as your\n",
      "mother justly says, is _not_ one’s own. To be tied down to the regular\n",
      "payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it\n",
      "takes away one’s independence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it. They think\n",
      "themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises\n",
      "no gratitude at all. If I were you, whatever I did should be done at my\n",
      "own discretion entirely. I would not bind myself to allow them any\n",
      "thing yearly. It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a\n",
      "hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should\n",
      "be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will\n",
      "be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they\n",
      "would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger\n",
      "income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the\n",
      "year. It will certainly be much the best way. A present of fifty\n",
      "pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for\n",
      "money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my\n",
      "father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure it will. Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within\n",
      "myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at\n",
      "all. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might\n",
      "be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a\n",
      "comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,\n",
      "and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they\n",
      "are in season. I’ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\n",
      "it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but consider,\n",
      "my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law\n",
      "and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,\n",
      "besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which\n",
      "brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will\n",
      "pay their mother for their board out of it. Altogether, they will have\n",
      "five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want\n",
      "for more than that?—They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will be\n",
      "nothing at all. They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any\n",
      "servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any\n",
      "kind! Only conceive how comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year!\n",
      "I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to\n",
      "your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be\n",
      "much more able to give _you_ something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said Mr. Dashwood, “I believe you are perfectly right.\n",
      "My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than\n",
      "what you say. I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil\n",
      "my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you\n",
      "have described. When my mother removes into another house my services\n",
      "shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can. Some little\n",
      "present of furniture too may be acceptable then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” returned Mrs. John Dashwood. “But, however, _one_ thing\n",
      "must be considered. When your father and mother moved to Norland,\n",
      "though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and\n",
      "linen was saved, and is now left to your mother. Her house will\n",
      "therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is a material consideration undoubtedly. A valuable legacy\n",
      "indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant\n",
      "addition to our own stock here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what\n",
      "belongs to this house. A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for\n",

      "Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any\n",
      "disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased\n",
      "to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when\n",
      "her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other\n",
      "exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy\n",
      "remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her\n",
      "inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for\n",
      "to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible. But she could hear\n",
      "of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease,\n",
      "and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment\n",
      "rejected several houses as too large for their income, which her mother\n",
      "would have approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on\n",
      "the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last\n",
      "earthly reflections. She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no\n",
      "more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her\n",
      "daughters’ sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was\n",
      "persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000£ would support her in\n",
      "affluence. For their brother’s sake, too, for the sake of his own\n",
      "heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his\n",
      "merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity. His attentive\n",
      "behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare\n",
      "was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the\n",
      "liberality of his intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for\n",
      "her daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge\n",
      "of her character, which half a year’s residence in her family afforded;\n",
      "and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal\n",
      "affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it\n",
      "impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular\n",
      "circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to\n",
      "the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters’ continuance at\n",
      "Norland.\n",
      "\n",
      "This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and\n",
      "the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young\n",
      "man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister’s\n",
      "establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of\n",
      "his time there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of\n",
      "interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died\n",
      "very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,\n",
      "for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the\n",
      "will of his mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either\n",
      "consideration. It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,\n",
      "that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality. It\n",
      "was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune\n",
      "should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of\n",
      "disposition; and that Elinor’s merit should not be acknowledged by\n",
      "every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any\n",
      "peculiar graces of person or address. He was not handsome, and his\n",
      "manners required intimacy to make them pleasing. He was too diffident\n",
      "to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\n",
      "his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart. His\n",
      "understanding was good, and his education had given it solid\n",
      "improvement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to\n",
      "answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him\n",
      "distinguished—as—they hardly knew what. They wanted him to make a fine\n",
      "figure in the world in some manner or other. His mother wished to\n",
      "interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to\n",
      "see him connected with some of the great men of the day. Mrs. John\n",
      "Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these\n",
      "superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her\n",
      "ambition to see him driving a barouche. But Edward had no turn for\n",
      "great men or barouches. All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and\n",
      "the quiet of private life. Fortunately he had a younger brother who was\n",
      "more promising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged\n",
      "much of Mrs. Dashwood’s attention; for she was, at that time, in such\n",
      "affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects. She saw\n",
      "only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He\n",
      "did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation.\n",
      "She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a\n",
      "reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference\n",
      "between him and his sister. It was a contrast which recommended him\n",
      "most forcibly to her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is enough,” said she; “to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough. It\n",
      "implies everything amiable. I love him already.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think you will like him,” said Elinor, “when you know more of him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Like him!” replied her mother with a smile. “I feel no sentiment of\n",
      "approbation inferior to love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may esteem him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him. Her manners\n",
      "were attaching, and soon banished his reserve. She speedily\n",
      "comprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor\n",
      "perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his\n",
      "worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all\n",
      "her established ideas of what a young man’s address ought to be, was no\n",
      "longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper\n",
      "affectionate.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to\n",
      "Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and\n",
      "looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a few months, my dear Marianne,” said she, “Elinor will, in all\n",

      "happy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My love, it will be scarcely a separation. We shall live within a few\n",
      "miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. You will\n",
      "gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother. I have the highest\n",
      "opinion in the world of Edward’s heart. But you look grave, Marianne;\n",
      "do you disapprove your sister’s choice?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps,” said Marianne, “I may consider it with some surprise. Edward\n",
      "is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet—he is not the kind of\n",
      "young man—there is something wanting—his figure is not striking; it has\n",
      "none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously\n",
      "attach my sister. His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at\n",
      "once announce virtue and intelligence. And besides all this, I am\n",
      "afraid, Mama, he has no real taste. Music seems scarcely to attract\n",
      "him, and though he admires Elinor’s drawings very much, it is not the\n",
      "admiration of a person who can understand their worth. It is evident,\n",
      "in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact\n",
      "he knows nothing of the matter. He admires as a lover, not as a\n",
      "connoisseur. To satisfy me, those characters must be united. I could\n",
      "not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide\n",
      "with my own. He must enter into all my feelings; the same books, the\n",
      "same music must charm us both. Oh! mama, how spiritless, how tame was\n",
      "Edward’s manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most\n",
      "severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely\n",
      "to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful\n",
      "lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such\n",
      "impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose.\n",
      "I thought so at the time; but you _would_ give him Cowper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!—but we must allow\n",
      "for difference of taste. Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she\n",
      "may overlook it, and be happy with him. But it would have broke _my_\n",
      "heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.\n",
      "Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I\n",
      "shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! He\n",
      "must have all Edward’s virtues, and his person and manners must\n",
      "ornament his goodness with every possible charm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early in\n",
      "life to despair of such a happiness. Why should you be less fortunate\n",

      "\n",
      "“What a pity it is, Elinor,” said Marianne, “that Edward should have no\n",
      "taste for drawing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No taste for drawing!” replied Elinor, “why should you think so? He\n",
      "does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the\n",
      "performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means\n",
      "deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of\n",
      "improving it. Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would\n",
      "have drawn very well. He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so\n",
      "much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture;\n",
      "but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in\n",
      "general direct him perfectly right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but\n",
      "the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the\n",
      "drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,\n",
      "which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste. Yet, though smiling\n",
      "within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for that blind\n",
      "partiality to Edward which produced it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope, Marianne,” continued Elinor, “you do not consider him as\n",
      "deficient in general taste. Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,\n",
      "for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if _that_ were your\n",
      "opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne hardly knew what to say. She would not wound the feelings of\n",
      "her sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was\n",
      "impossible. At length she replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing\n",
      "equal to your sense of his merits. I have not had so many opportunities\n",
      "of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his inclinations\n",
      "and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world of\n",
      "his goodness and sense. I think him every thing that is worthy and\n",
      "amiable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure,” replied Elinor, with a smile, “that his dearest friends\n",
      "could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that. I do not\n",
      "perceive how you could express yourself more warmly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of his sense and his goodness,” continued Elinor, “no one can, I\n",
      "think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in\n",
      "unreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his\n",
      "principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps\n",
      "him silent. You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.\n",
      "But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from\n",
      "peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He and I\n",
      "have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been\n",
      "wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I\n",
      "have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard\n",
      "his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I\n",
      "venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books\n",
      "exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and\n",
      "correct, and his taste delicate and pure. His abilities in every\n",
      "respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person. At\n",
      "first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person can\n",
      "hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which are\n",
      "uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is\n",
      "perceived. At present, I know him so well, that I think him really\n",
      "handsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now. When\n",
      "you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection\n",
      "in his face, than I now do in his heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she\n",
      "had been betrayed into, in speaking of him. She felt that Edward stood\n",
      "very high in her opinion. She believed the regard to be mutual; but she\n",
      "required greater certainty of it to make Marianne’s conviction of their\n",
      "attachment agreeable to her. She knew that what Marianne and her mother\n",
      "conjectured one moment, they believed the next—that with them, to wish\n",
      "was to hope, and to hope was to expect. She tried to explain the real\n",
      "state of the case to her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not attempt to deny,” said she, “that I think very highly of\n",
      "him—that I greatly esteem, that I like him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne here burst forth with indignation—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than\n",
      "cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I\n",
      "will leave the room this moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not help laughing. “Excuse me,” said she; “and be assured\n",
      "that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my\n",
      "own feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believe\n",
      "them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion—the hope of\n",
      "his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly. But\n",
      "farther than this you must _not_ believe. I am by no means assured of\n",
      "his regard for me. There are moments when the extent of it seems\n",
      "doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at\n",
      "my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by\n",
      "believing or calling it more than it is. In my heart I feel\n",
      "little—scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other points\n",
      "to be considered besides his inclination. He is very far from being\n",
      "independent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from\n",
      "Fanny’s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never\n",
      "been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if\n",
      "Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in\n",
      "his way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great\n",
      "fortune or high rank.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother\n",
      "and herself had outstripped the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you really are not engaged to him!” said she. “Yet it certainly\n",
      "soon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. _I_\n",
      "shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of\n",
      "improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be\n",
      "so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he should be\n",
      "so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how\n",
      "delightful it would be!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister. She could not consider\n",
      "her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had\n",
      "believed it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which, if\n",
      "it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as\n",
      "unpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not\n",
      "give him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to produce that\n",
      "dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more reasonable\n",
      "cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the\n",
      "indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother neither behaved\n",
      "to him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him\n",
      "any assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly\n",
      "attending to her views for his aggrandizement. With such a knowledge as\n",
      "this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject. She was\n",
      "far from depending on that result of his preference of her, which her\n",
      "mother and sister still considered as certain. Nay, the longer they\n",
      "were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and\n",
      "sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more\n",
      "than friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived\n",
      "by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which was\n",
      "still more common,) to make her uncivil. She took the first opportunity\n",
      "of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to her so\n",
      "expressively of her brother’s great expectations, of Mrs. Ferrars’s\n",
      "resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the danger\n",
      "attending any young woman who attempted to _draw him in;_ that Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be\n",
      "calm. She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and instantly\n",
      "left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or\n",
      "expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not be\n",
      "exposed another week to such insinuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the\n",
      "post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. It was the\n",
      "offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of\n",
      "her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. The\n",
      "letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit\n",
      "of friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a\n",
      "dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,\n",
      "he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might\n",
      "think necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly pressed\n",
      "her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with\n",
      "her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from\n",
      "whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses\n",
      "were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable\n",
      "to her. He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of\n",
      "his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of\n",
      "giving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was\n",
      "suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer\n",
      "connections. She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. Her\n",
      "resolution was formed as she read. The situation of Barton, in a county\n",
      "so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours\n",
      "before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every\n",
      "possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first\n",
      "recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an\n",
      "evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of\n",
      "the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law’s guest; and to remove for\n",
      "ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or\n",
      "visit it while such a woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir\n",
      "John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance\n",
      "of his proposal; and then hastened to show both letters to her\n",
      "daughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before her\n",
      "answer were sent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle\n",

      "described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so\n",
      "uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either\n",
      "point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm\n",
      "to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland\n",

      "No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged\n",
      "herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife\n",
      "that she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer\n",
      "than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They heard her\n",
      "with surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly\n",
      "hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland. She had great\n",
      "satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.—Edward\n",
      "turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of\n",
      "surprise and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated,\n",
      "“Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to\n",
      "what part of it?” She explained the situation. It was within four miles\n",
      "northward of Exeter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is but a cottage,” she continued, “but I hope to see many of my\n",
      "friends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends\n",
      "find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will\n",
      "find none in accommodating them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood\n",
      "to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greater\n",
      "affection. Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had\n",
      "made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was\n",
      "unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that\n",
      "point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and Elinor was\n",
      "as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John\n",
      "Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she\n",
      "disregarded her disapprobation of the match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry\n",
      "he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to\n",
      "prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture. He\n",
      "really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very\n",
      "exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his\n",
      "father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.—The furniture\n",
      "was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of household linen,\n",
      "plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne’s. Mrs.\n",
      "John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not help\n",
      "feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood’s income would be so trifling in\n",
      "comparison with their own, she should have any handsome article of\n",
      "furniture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished,\n",
      "and she might have immediate possession. No difficulty arose on either\n",
      "side in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of her\n",
      "effects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she\n",
      "set off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in the\n",
      "performance of everything that interested her, was soon done.—The\n",
      "horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his\n",
      "death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage,\n",
      "she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest\n",
      "daughter. For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her\n",
      "own wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor\n",
      "prevailed. _Her_ wisdom too limited the number of their servants to\n",
      "three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from\n",
      "amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire,\n",
      "to prepare the house for their mistress’s arrival; for as Lady\n",
      "Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going\n",
      "directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she\n",
      "relied so undoubtingly on Sir John’s description of the house, as to\n",
      "feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own.\n",
      "Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by\n",
      "the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her\n",
      "removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed\n",
      "under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure. Now was the time\n",
      "when her son-in-law’s promise to his father might with particular\n",
      "propriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do it on first coming\n",
      "to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as the most\n",
      "suitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly\n",
      "to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the\n",
      "general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no farther\n",
      "than their maintenance for six months at Norland. He so frequently\n",
      "talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of the perpetual\n",
      "demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in the world was\n",
      "beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand in need\n",

      "spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!—And you, ye\n",
      "well-known trees!—but you will continue the same.—No leaf will decay\n",

      "The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a\n",
      "disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant. But as they\n",
      "drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a\n",
      "country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view\n",
      "of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness. It was a\n",
      "pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. After winding\n",
      "along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house. A small\n",
      "green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket\n",
      "gate admitted them into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;\n",
      "but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the\n",
      "roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were\n",
      "the walls covered with honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly\n",
      "through the house into the garden behind. On each side of the entrance\n",
      "was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the\n",
      "offices and the stairs. Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest\n",
      "of the house. It had not been built many years and was in good repair.\n",
      "In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!—but the tears\n",
      "which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon\n",
      "dried away. They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their\n",
      "arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.\n",
      "It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from first\n",
      "seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an\n",
      "impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending\n",
      "it to their lasting approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation of the house was good. High hills rose immediately\n",
      "behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open\n",
      "downs, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was\n",
      "chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the\n",
      "cottage windows. The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded\n",
      "the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond. The hills\n",
      "which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction;\n",
      "under another name, and in another course, it branched out again\n",
      "between two of the steepest of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the\n",
      "whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered many\n",
      "additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a\n",
      "delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply\n",
      "all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments. “As for the\n",
      "house itself, to be sure,” said she, “it is too small for our family,\n",
      "but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it\n",
      "is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in the spring, if I\n",
      "have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about\n",
      "building. These parlors are both too small for such parties of our\n",
      "friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts\n",
      "of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the\n",
      "other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this,\n",
      "with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber\n",
      "and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage. I could wish\n",
      "the stairs were handsome. But one must not expect every thing; though I\n",
      "suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them. I shall see how\n",
      "much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and we will plan\n",
      "our improvements accordingly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the\n",
      "savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved\n",
      "in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it\n",
      "was; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns,\n",
      "and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to\n",
      "form themselves a home. Marianne’s pianoforte was unpacked and properly\n",
      "disposed of; and Elinor’s drawings were affixed to the walls of their\n",

      "\n",
      "In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast\n",
      "the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcome\n",
      "them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his own\n",
      "house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient. Sir\n",
      "John Middleton was a good looking man about forty. He had formerly\n",
      "visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins to\n",
      "remember him. His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and his\n",
      "manners were as friendly as the style of his letter. Their arrival\n",
      "seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be an\n",
      "object of real solicitude to him. He said much of his earnest desire of\n",
      "their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressed\n",
      "them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were\n",
      "better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to a\n",
      "point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence. His\n",
      "kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he left\n",
      "them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the\n",
      "park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of\n",
      "game. He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to and from\n",
      "the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending\n",
      "them his newspaper every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her\n",
      "intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured\n",
      "that her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was\n",
      "answered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced\n",
      "to them the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of\n",
      "their comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearance\n",
      "was favourable to their wishes. Lady Middleton was not more than six or\n",
      "seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,\n",
      "and her address graceful. Her manners had all the elegance which her\n",
      "husband’s wanted. But they would have been improved by some share of\n",
      "his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough to detract\n",
      "something from their first admiration, by showing that, though\n",
      "perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for\n",
      "herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and\n",
      "Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their\n",
      "eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which means\n",
      "there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of\n",
      "extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty,\n",
      "and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hung\n",
      "about her and held down his head, to the great surprise of her\n",
      "ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he could\n",
      "make noise enough at home. On every formal visit a child ought to be of\n",
      "the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the present case it\n",
      "took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his\n",
      "father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of\n",
      "course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the\n",
      "opinion of the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the\n",

      "Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage. The ladies had\n",
      "passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from\n",
      "their view at home by the projection of a hill. The house was large and\n",
      "handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and\n",
      "elegance. The former was for Sir John’s gratification, the latter for\n",
      "that of his lady. They were scarcely ever without some friends staying\n",
      "with them in the house, and they kept more company of every kind than\n",
      "any other family in the neighbourhood. It was necessary to the\n",
      "happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward\n",
      "behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of\n",
      "talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with\n",
      "such as society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a\n",
      "sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she\n",
      "humoured her children; and these were their only resources. Lady\n",
      "Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the\n",
      "year round, while Sir John’s independent employments were in existence\n",
      "only half the time. Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,\n",
      "supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported the\n",
      "good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his\n",
      "wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of\n",
      "all her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her\n",
      "greatest enjoyment in any of their parties. But Sir John’s satisfaction\n",
      "in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting about him\n",
      "more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier they were\n",
      "the better was he pleased. He was a blessing to all the juvenile part\n",
      "of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever forming parties to\n",
      "eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private balls\n",
      "were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the\n",
      "unsatiable appetite of fifteen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy\n",

      "he had now procured for his cottage at Barton. The Miss Dashwoods were\n",
      "young, pretty, and unaffected. It was enough to secure his good\n",
      "opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to\n",
      "make her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness of his\n",
      "disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation\n",
      "might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In\n",
      "showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\n",
      "of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his\n",
      "cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,\n",
      "though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is\n",

      "ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day\n",
      "before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them. They\n",
      "would see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a\n",
      "particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither very\n",
      "young nor very gay. He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the\n",
      "party, and could assure them it should never happen so again. He had\n",
      "been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some\n",
      "addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full\n",
      "of engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton’s mother had arrived at Barton\n",
      "within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman,\n",

      "husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,\n",

      "resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be\n",
      "his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton’s mother. He was silent\n",
      "and grave. His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite of his\n",
      "being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor,\n",
      "for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though his face\n",

      "particularly gentlemanlike.\n",

      "There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as\n",
      "companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton\n",
      "was so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity of\n",
      "Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his\n",
      "mother-in-law was interesting. Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to\n",
      "enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner,\n",
      "who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of\n",
      "discourse except what related to themselves.\n",

      "In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was\n",
      "invited to play. The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to be\n",
      "charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went\n",
      "through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into\n",
      "the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in\n",
      "the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated\n",
      "that event by giving up music, although by her mother’s account, she\n",
      "had played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.\n",
      "\n",

      "admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation\n",
      "with the others while every song lasted. Lady Middleton frequently\n",
      "called him to order, wondered how any one’s attention could be diverted\n",
      "from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song\n",
      "which Marianne had just finished. Colonel Brandon alone, of all the\n",
      "party, heard her without being in raptures. He paid her only the\n",

      "she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the\n",

      "as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting\n",
      "weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance. She was\n",
      "remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the\n",
      "advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by\n",
      "insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of\n",
      "discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to\n",
      "pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne\n",
      "Dashwood. She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening\n",
      "of their being together, from his listening so attentively while she\n",
      "sang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons’ dining\n",
      "at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.\n",
      "It must be so. She was perfectly convinced of it. It would be an\n",
      "excellent match, for _he_ was rich, and _she_ was handsome. Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever\n",
      "since her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;\n",
      "and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for\n",
      "it supplied her with endless jokes against them both. At the park she\n",
      "laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne. To the former\n",
      "her raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,\n",
      "perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first\n",
      "incomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knew\n",
      "whether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,\n",
      "for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel’s\n",
      "advanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.\n",

      "Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than\n",

      "“But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,\n",
      "though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured. Colonel Brandon\n",
      "is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be\n",
      "_my_ father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must\n",
      "have long outlived every sensation of the kind. It is too ridiculous!\n",
      "When is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not\n",

      "“Infirmity!” said Elinor, “do you call Colonel Brandon infirm? I can\n",

      "But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps,” said Elinor, “thirty-five and seventeen had better not have\n",

      "uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bring\n",
      "herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the\n",
      "provision and security of a wife. In his marrying such a woman\n",
      "therefore there would be nothing unsuitable. It would be a compact of\n",
      "convenience, and the world would be satisfied. In my eyes it would be\n",
      "no marriage at all, but that would be nothing. To me it would seem only\n",
      "a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the\n",
      "expense of the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be impossible, I know,” replied Elinor, “to convince you that\n",
      "a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five\n",
      "anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.\n",
      "But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the\n",
      "constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced to\n",

      "The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to\n",
      "themselves. The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding\n",
      "them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had\n",
      "given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater\n",
      "enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of their\n",
      "father. Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first\n",
      "fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at\n",
      "home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in\n",
      "spite of Sir John’s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the\n",
      "neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at\n",
      "their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood’s spirit overcame the\n",
      "wish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to\n",
      "visit any family beyond the distance of a walk. There were but few who\n",
      "could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.\n",
      "About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding\n",
      "valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly\n",
      "described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an\n",
      "ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little\n",
      "of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be\n",
      "better acquainted with it. But they learnt, on enquiry, that its\n",
      "possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately\n",
      "too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks. The high\n",
      "downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to\n",
      "seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy\n",
      "alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior\n",
      "beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one\n",
      "memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine\n",
      "of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the\n",
      "settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned. The weather was\n",
      "not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their\n",
      "book, in spite of Marianne’s declaration that the day would be\n",
      "lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off\n",
      "from their hills; and the two girls set off together.\n",
      "\n",
      "They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at\n",
      "every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the\n",
      "animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears\n",
      "which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such\n",
      "delightful sensations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there a felicity in the world,” said Marianne, “superior to\n",
      "this?—Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting\n",
      "it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly\n",
      "the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in\n",
      "their face. Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though\n",
      "unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own\n",
      "house. One consolation however remained for them, to which the exigence\n",
      "of the moment gave more than usual propriety,—it was that of running\n",
      "with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led\n",
      "immediately to their garden gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "They set off. Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step\n",
      "brought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop\n",
      "herself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the\n",
      "bottom in safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was\n",
      "passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her\n",
      "accident happened. He put down his gun and ran to her assistance. She\n",
      "had raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in\n",
      "her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand. The gentleman offered his\n",
      "services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation\n",
      "rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther delay, and\n",
      "carried her down the hill. Then passing through the garden, the gate of\n",
      "which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly into the\n",
      "house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his hold till\n",
      "he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while\n",
      "the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret\n",
      "admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for\n",
      "his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so\n",
      "graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received\n",
      "additional charms from his voice and expression. Had he been even old,\n",
      "ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would\n",
      "have been secured by any act of attention to her child; but the\n",
      "influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the\n",
      "action which came home to her feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which\n",
      "always attended her, invited him to be seated. But this he declined, as\n",
      "he was dirty and wet. Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was\n",
      "obliged. His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present home was\n",
      "at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of\n",
      "calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood. The honour was readily\n",
      "granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting,\n",
      "in the midst of a heavy rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the\n",
      "theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised\n",
      "against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior\n",
      "attractions. Marianne herself had seen less of his person than the\n",
      "rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting\n",
      "her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their\n",
      "entering the house. But she had seen enough of him to join in all the\n",
      "admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her\n",
      "praise. His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn\n",
      "for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the\n",
      "house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of\n",
      "thought which particularly recommended the action to her. Every\n",
      "circumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his\n",
      "residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that\n",
      "of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming. Her\n",
      "imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a\n",
      "sprained ankle was disregarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather\n",
      "that morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne’s accident\n",
      "being related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any\n",
      "gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Willoughby!” cried Sir John; “what, is _he_ in the country? That is\n",
      "good news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on\n",
      "Thursday.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "today?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.\n",

      "mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But who is he?” said Elinor. “Where does he come from? Has he a house\n",
      "at Allenham?”\n",
      "\n",
      "On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he\n",
      "told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the\n",
      "country; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady\n",
      "at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was\n",
      "to inherit; adding, “Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I can\n",
      "tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own in\n",
      "Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to my\n",
      "younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. Miss Marianne\n",
      "must not expect to have all the men to herself. Brandon will be\n",

      "“that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of\n",
      "_my_ daughters towards what you call _catching him_. It is not an\n",
      "employment to which they have been brought up. Men are very safe with\n",
      "us, let them be ever so rich. I am glad to find, however, from what you\n",
      "say, that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance\n",
      "will not be ineligible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,” repeated\n",

      "“Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be. Whatever be\n",

      "\n",
      "“Aye, aye, I see how it will be,” said Sir John, “I see how it will be.\n",

      "remembrance of his assistance created. But when this passed away, when\n",
      "her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfect\n",
      "good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, and\n",
      "above all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he was\n",
      "passionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as secured\n",
      "the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her\n",
      "to talk. She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and\n",
      "she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion. They speedily\n",
      "discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and\n",
      "that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related\n",
      "to either. Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,\n",
      "she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her favourite\n",
      "authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a\n",
      "delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have been\n",
      "insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence\n",
      "of such works, however disregarded before. Their taste was strikingly\n",
      "alike. The same books, the same passages were idolized by each—or if\n",
      "any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than\n",
      "till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be\n",
      "displayed. He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her\n",
      "enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed with\n",
      "the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Marianne,” said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, “for _one_\n",
      "morning I think you have done pretty well. You have already ascertained\n",
      "Mr. Willoughby’s opinion in almost every matter of importance. You know\n",
      "what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating\n",
      "their beauties as he ought, and you have received every assurance of\n",
      "his admiring Pope no more than is proper. But how is your acquaintance\n",
      "to be long supported, under such extraordinary despatch of every\n",
      "subject for discourse? You will soon have exhausted each favourite\n",
      "topic. Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on\n",
      "picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then you can have nothing\n",
      "farther to ask.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Elinor,” cried Marianne, “is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so\n",
      "scanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too\n",
      "happy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of\n",
      "decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been\n",
      "reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful—had I talked only of the\n",
      "weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this\n",
      "reproach would have been spared.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My love,” said her mother, “you must not be offended with Elinor—she\n",
      "was only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were capable of\n",
      "wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend.”\n",
      "Marianne was softened in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their\n",
      "acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer. He\n",
      "came to them every day. To enquire after Marianne was at first his\n",
      "excuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave\n",
      "greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased\n",
      "to be possible, by Marianne’s perfect recovery. She was confined for\n",
      "some days to the house; but never had any confinement been less\n",
      "irksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick\n",
      "imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was\n",
      "exactly formed to engage Marianne’s heart, for with all this, he joined\n",
      "not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was\n",
      "now roused and increased by the example of her own, and which\n",
      "recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.\n",
      "\n",
      "His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. They read,\n",
      "they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable;\n",
      "and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had\n",
      "unfortunately wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Mrs. Dashwood’s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne’s; and\n",
      "Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he\n",
      "strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too\n",
      "much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or\n",
      "circumstances. In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other\n",
      "people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided\n",
      "attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the\n",
      "forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinor\n",
      "could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in\n",
      "its support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized\n",
      "her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her\n",
      "ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable. Willoughby was\n",
      "all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every\n",
      "brighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour\n",
      "declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities\n",
      "were strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their\n",
      "marriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before the\n",
      "end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate\n",
      "herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon’s partiality for Marianne, which had so early been\n",
      "discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when\n",
      "it ceased to be noticed by them. Their attention and wit were drawn off\n",
      "to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had\n",
      "incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelings\n",
      "began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.\n",
      "Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments\n",
      "which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were now\n",
      "actually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblance\n",
      "of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.\n",
      "Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no\n",
      "hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon. She saw it with concern;\n",
      "for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a\n",
      "very lively one of five and twenty? and as she could not even wish him\n",
      "successful, she heartily wished him indifferent. She liked him—in spite\n",
      "of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.\n",
      "His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve appeared rather\n",
      "the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess\n",
      "of temper. Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and\n",
      "disappointments, which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate\n",
      "man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by\n",
      "Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neither\n",
      "lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Brandon is just the kind of man,” said Willoughby one day, when they\n",
      "were talking of him together, “whom every body speaks well of, and\n",
      "nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers\n",
      "to talk to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is exactly what I think of him,” cried Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not boast of it, however,” said Elinor, “for it is injustice in\n",
      "both of you. He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and I\n",
      "never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That he is patronised by _you_,” replied Willoughby, “is certainly in\n",
      "his favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in\n",
      "itself. Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a\n",
      "woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the\n",
      "indifference of any body else?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will\n",
      "make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother. If their\n",
      "praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more\n",
      "undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In defence of your _protégé_ you can even be saucy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My _protégé_, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will\n",
      "always have attractions for me. Yes, Marianne, even in a man between\n",
      "thirty and forty. He has seen a great deal of the world; has been\n",
      "abroad, has read, and has a thinking mind. I have found him capable of\n",
      "giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always\n",
      "answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is to say,” cried Marianne contemptuously, “he has told you, that\n",
      "in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are\n",
      "troublesome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He _would_ have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such\n",
      "inquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been\n",
      "previously informed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps,” said Willoughby, “his observations may have extended to the\n",
      "existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I may venture to say that _his_ observations have stretched much\n",
      "further than _your_ candour. But why should you dislike him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not dislike him. I consider him, on the contrary, as a very\n",
      "respectable man, who has every body’s good word, and nobody’s notice;\n",
      "who has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to\n",
      "employ, and two new coats every year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Add to which,” cried Marianne, “that he has neither genius, taste, nor\n",
      "spirit. That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no\n",
      "ardour, and his voice no expression.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,” replied Elinor,\n",
      "“and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the\n",
      "commendation _I_ am able to give of him is comparatively cold and\n",
      "insipid. I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,\n",
      "well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable\n",
      "heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Dashwood,” cried Willoughby, “you are now using me unkindly. You\n",
      "are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my\n",
      "will. But it will not do. You shall find me as stubborn as you can be\n",
      "artful. I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel\n",
      "Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has\n",
      "found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him\n",
      "to buy my brown mare. If it will be any satisfaction to you, however,\n",
      "to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respects\n",
      "irreproachable, I am ready to confess it. And in return for an\n",
      "acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me the\n",

      "CHAPTER XI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came\n",
      "into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their\n",
      "time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such\n",
      "frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little\n",
      "leisure for serious employment. Yet such was the case. When Marianne\n",
      "was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir\n",
      "John had been previously forming, were put into execution. The private\n",
      "balls at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and\n",
      "accomplished as often as a showery October would allow. In every\n",
      "meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and\n",
      "familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly\n",
      "calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the\n",
      "Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of\n",
      "Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,\n",
      "in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her\n",
      "affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She only wished that\n",
      "it were less openly shown; and once or twice did venture to suggest the\n",
      "propriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne abhorred all\n",
      "concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve; and to aim\n",
      "at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable,\n",
      "appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful\n",
      "subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions. Willoughby\n",
      "thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an illustration\n",
      "of their opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was present she had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he\n",
      "did, was right. Every thing he said, was clever. If their evenings at\n",
      "the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the rest\n",
      "of the party to get her a good hand. If dancing formed the amusement of\n",
      "the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to\n",
      "separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and\n",
      "scarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made them of\n",
      "course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and\n",
      "seemed hardly to provoke them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left\n",
      "her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them. To her\n",
      "it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and\n",
      "ardent mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the season of happiness to Marianne. Her heart was devoted to\n",
      "Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with\n",
      "her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought it\n",
      "possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her\n",
      "present home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor’s happiness was not so great. Her heart was not so much at ease,\n",
      "nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure. They afforded her no\n",
      "companion that could make amends for what she had left behind, nor that\n",
      "could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever. Neither\n",
      "Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation\n",
      "she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker, and from the\n",
      "first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share\n",
      "of her discourse. She had already repeated her own history to Elinor\n",
      "three or four times; and had Elinor’s memory been equal to her means of\n",
      "improvement, she might have known very early in their acquaintance all\n",
      "the particulars of Mr. Jennings’s last illness, and what he said to his\n",
      "wife a few minutes before he died. Lady Middleton was more agreeable\n",
      "than her mother only in being more silent. Elinor needed little\n",
      "observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner\n",
      "with which sense had nothing to do. Towards her husband and mother she\n",
      "was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be\n",
      "looked for nor desired. She had nothing to say one day that she had not\n",
      "said the day before. Her insipidity was invariable, for even her\n",
      "spirits were always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties\n",
      "arranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted in style\n",
      "and her two eldest children attended her, she never appeared to receive\n",
      "more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at\n",
      "home;—and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others,\n",
      "by any share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only\n",
      "reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her\n",
      "troublesome boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find\n",
      "a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite\n",
      "the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion. Willoughby\n",
      "was out of the question. Her admiration and regard, even her sisterly\n",
      "regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his attentions were wholly\n",
      "Marianne’s, and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally\n",
      "pleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such\n",
      "encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing with Elinor\n",
      "he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor’s compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect\n",
      "that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.\n",
      "This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from\n",
      "him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by\n",
      "mutual consent, while the others were dancing. His eyes were fixed on\n",
      "Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint\n",
      "smile, “Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second\n",
      "attachments.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied Elinor, “her opinions are all romantic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe she does. But how she contrives it without reflecting on the\n",
      "character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not. A\n",
      "few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of\n",
      "common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define\n",
      "and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This will probably be the case,” he replied; “and yet there is\n",
      "something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is\n",
      "sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot agree with you there,” said Elinor. “There are inconveniences\n",
      "attending such feelings as Marianne’s, which all the charms of\n",
      "enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her systems\n",
      "have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought; and a\n",
      "better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her\n",
      "greatest possible advantage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a\n",
      "second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body? Are those\n",
      "who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the\n",
      "inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be\n",
      "equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles.\n",
      "I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second\n",
      "attachment’s being pardonable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This,” said he, “cannot hold; but a change, a total change of\n",
      "sentiments—No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements\n",
      "of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they\n",
      "succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous! I\n",
      "speak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper and mind\n",
      "greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who\n",
      "from an enforced change—from a series of unfortunate circumstances—”\n",
      "Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much,\n",
      "and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not\n",
      "otherwise have entered Elinor’s head. The lady would probably have\n",
      "passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what\n",
      "concerned her ought not to escape his lips. As it was, it required but\n",
      "a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender\n",
      "recollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more. But Marianne, in\n",
      "her place, would not have done so little. The whole story would have\n",
      "been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing\n",
      "established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.\n",

      "As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the\n",
      "latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of\n",
      "all that she knew before of Marianne’s imprudence and want of thought,\n",
      "surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both. Marianne told her,\n",
      "with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one\n",
      "that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was\n",
      "exactly calculated to carry a woman. Without considering that it was\n",
      "not in her mother’s plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter\n",
      "her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the\n",
      "servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable\n",

      "Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to\n",
      "comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for\n",
      "some time she refused to submit to them. As to an additional servant,\n",
      "the expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object to\n",
      "it; and any horse would do for _him;_ he might always get one at the\n",
      "park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor then\n",
      "ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a\n",
      "man so little, or at least so lately known to her. This was too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are mistaken, Elinor,” said she warmly, “in supposing I know very\n",
      "little of Willoughby. I have not known him long indeed, but I am much\n",
      "better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the\n",
      "world, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that is\n",
      "to determine intimacy;—it is disposition alone. Seven years would be\n",
      "insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\n",
      "days are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of\n",
      "greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from\n",
      "Willoughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together\n",
      "for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. She knew her\n",
      "sister’s temper. Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach\n",
      "her the more to her own opinion. But by an appeal to her affection for\n",
      "her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent\n",
      "mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she\n",
      "consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly\n",
      "subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent\n",
      "kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw\n",
      "him next, that it must be declined.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the\n",
      "cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to\n",
      "him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his\n",
      "present. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related,\n",
      "and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible.\n",
      "His concern however was very apparent; and after expressing it with\n",
      "earnestness, he added, in the same low voice,—“But, Marianne, the horse\n",
      "is still yours, though you cannot use it now. I shall keep it only till\n",
      "you can claim it. When you leave Barton to form your own establishment\n",
      "in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall receive you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the\n",
      "sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her\n",
      "sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so\n",
      "decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between\n",
      "them. From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each\n",
      "other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, or\n",
      "any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover\n",
      "it by accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed this\n",
      "matter in a still clearer light. Willoughby had spent the preceding\n",
      "evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour\n",
      "with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,\n",
      "which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldest\n",
      "sister, when they were next by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Elinor!” she cried, “I have such a secret to tell you about\n",
      "Marianne. I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have said so,” replied Elinor, “almost every day since they first\n",
      "met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I\n",
      "believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round\n",
      "her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great\n",
      "uncle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But indeed this is quite another thing. I am sure they will be married\n",
      "very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take care, Margaret. It may be only the hair of some great uncle of\n",
      "_his_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne’s. I am almost sure it is, for I\n",
      "saw him cut it off. Last night after tea, when you and mama went out of\n",
      "the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could\n",
      "be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took\n",
      "up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all\n",
      "tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of\n",
      "white paper; and put it into his pocket-book.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not\n",
      "withhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance\n",
      "was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret’s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory\n",
      "to her sister. When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park,\n",
      "to give the name of the young man who was Elinor’s particular\n",
      "favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,\n",
      "Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, “I must not\n",
      "tell, may I, Elinor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.\n",
      "But the effort was painful. She was convinced that Margaret had fixed\n",
      "on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a\n",
      "standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good\n",
      "to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to\n",
      "Margaret,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to\n",
      "repeat them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never had any conjectures about it,” replied Margaret; “it was you\n",
      "who told me of it yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly\n",
      "pressed to say something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,” said Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings. “What is the gentleman’s name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must not tell, ma’am. But I know very well what it is; and I know\n",
      "where he is too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be\n",
      "sure. He is the curate of the parish I dare say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, _that_ he is not. He is of no profession at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Margaret,” said Marianne with great warmth, “you know that all this is\n",
      "an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in\n",
      "existence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such\n",
      "a man once, and his name begins with an F.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this\n",
      "moment, “that it rained very hard,” though she believed the\n",
      "interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her\n",
      "ladyship’s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as\n",
      "delighted her husband and mother. The idea however started by her, was\n",
      "immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion\n",
      "mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of\n",
      "rain by both of them. Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked\n",
      "Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of\n",
      "different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground. But not so\n",
      "easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.\n",
      "\n",
      "A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a\n",
      "very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a\n",
      "brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not\n",
      "be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders\n",
      "on that head. The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and Sir\n",
      "John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed to be\n",
      "a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at least,\n",
      "twice every summer for the last ten years. They contained a noble piece\n",
      "of water; a sail on which was to form a great part of the morning’s\n",
      "amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages only to be\n",
      "employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete\n",
      "party of pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,\n",
      "considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the\n",
      "last fortnight;—and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was\n",
      "persuaded by Elinor to stay at home.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER XIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from\n",
      "what Elinor had expected. She was prepared to be wet through, fatigued,\n",
      "and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for they did\n",
      "not go at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "By ten o’clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they\n",
      "were to breakfast. The morning was rather favourable, though it had\n",
      "rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,\n",
      "and the sun frequently appeared. They were all in high spirits and good\n",
      "humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the greatest\n",
      "inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in. Among the\n",
      "rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;—he took it, looked at the\n",
      "direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter with Brandon?” said Sir John.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody could tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope he has had no bad news,” said Lady Middleton. “It must be\n",
      "something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my\n",
      "breakfast table so suddenly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In about five minutes he returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No bad news, Colonel, I hope;” said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he\n",
      "entered the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“None at all, ma’am, I thank you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was it from Avignon? I hope it is not to say that your sister is\n",
      "worse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, ma’am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a\n",
      "letter of business? Come, come, this won’t do, Colonel; so let us hear\n",
      "the truth of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear madam,” said Lady Middleton, “recollect what you are saying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?” said\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter’s reproof.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed, it is not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel. And I hope she is well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whom do you mean, ma’am?” said he, colouring a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! you know who I mean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am particularly sorry, ma’am,” said he, addressing Lady Middleton,\n",
      "“that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which\n",
      "requires my immediate attendance in town.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In town!” cried Mrs. Jennings. “What can you have to do in town at\n",
      "this time of year?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My own loss is great,” he continued, “in being obliged to leave so\n",
      "agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence\n",
      "is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What a blow upon them all was this!\n",
      "\n",
      "“But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,” said\n",
      "Marianne, eagerly, “will it not be sufficient?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must go,” said Sir John.—“It shall not be put off when we are so\n",
      "near it. You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish it could be so easily settled. But it is not in my power to\n",
      "delay my journey for one day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you would but let us know what your business is,” said Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, “we might see whether it could be put off or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You would not be six hours later,” said Willoughby, “if you were to\n",
      "defer your journey till our return.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot afford to lose _one_ hour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, “There\n",
      "are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. Brandon is one of\n",
      "them. He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this\n",
      "trick for getting out of it. I would lay fifty guineas the letter was\n",
      "of his own writing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no doubt of it,” replied Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of\n",
      "old,” said Sir John, “when once you are determined on anything. But,\n",
      "however, I hope you will think better of it. Consider, here are the two\n",
      "Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked up\n",
      "from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual\n",
      "time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of\n",
      "disappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be\n",
      "unavoidable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, when will you come back again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope we shall see you at Barton,” added her ladyship, “as soon as\n",
      "you can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to\n",
      "Whitwell till you return.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very obliging. But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in\n",
      "my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! he must and shall come back,” cried Sir John. “If he is not here\n",
      "by the end of the week, I shall go after him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, so do, Sir John,” cried Mrs. Jennings, “and then perhaps you may\n",
      "find out what his business is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not want to pry into other men’s concerns. I suppose it is\n",
      "something he is ashamed of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon’s horses were announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do not go to town on horseback, do you?” added Sir John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Only to Honiton. I shall then go post.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey. But you\n",
      "had better change your mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I assure you it is not in my power.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then took leave of the whole party.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this\n",
      "winter, Miss Dashwood?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid, none at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to\n",
      "do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come Colonel,” said Mrs. Jennings, “before you go, do let us know what\n",
      "you are going about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto\n",
      "restrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and\n",
      "again how provoking it was to be so disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can guess what his business is, however,” said Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "exultingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you, ma’am?” said almost every body.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who is Miss Williams?” asked Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have\n",
      "heard of her before. She is a relation of the Colonel’s, my dear; a\n",
      "very near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the\n",
      "young ladies.” Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,\n",
      "“She is his natural daughter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare. I dare say the Colonel will\n",
      "leave her all his fortune.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret\n",
      "on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as\n",
      "they were all got together, they must do something by way of being\n",
      "happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although\n",
      "happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a\n",
      "tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country. The carriages\n",
      "were then ordered; Willoughby’s was first, and Marianne never looked\n",
      "happier than when she got into it. He drove through the park very fast,\n",
      "and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of them was seen till\n",
      "their return, which did not happen till after the return of all the\n",
      "rest. They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said only in\n",
      "general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others went on\n",
      "the downs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that\n",
      "every body should be extremely merry all day long. Some more of the\n",
      "Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly\n",
      "twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.\n",
      "Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor’s right hand; and they had not been long\n",
      "seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to\n",
      "Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, “I have found you out in\n",
      "spite of all your tricks. I know where you spent the morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, “Where, pray?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did not you know,” said Willoughby, “that we had been out in my\n",
      "curricle?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined\n",
      "to find out _where_ you had been to. I hope you like your house, Miss\n",
      "Marianne. It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you, I\n",
      "hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when I\n",
      "was there six years ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs. Jennings laughed\n",
      "heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they\n",
      "had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.\n",
      "Willoughby’s groom; and that she had by that method been informed that\n",
      "they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in\n",
      "walking about the garden and going all over the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely\n",
      "that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house\n",
      "while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest\n",
      "acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;\n",
      "and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance\n",
      "related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true. Marianne was quite angry\n",
      "with her for doubting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we\n",
      "did not see the house? Is not it what you have often wished to do\n",
      "yourself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with\n",
      "no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.”\n",

      "thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved. I do\n",

      "family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. The\n",

      "that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in\n",

      "belonging to it;—in no one convenience or inconvenience about it,\n",
      "should the least variation be perceptible. Then, and then only, under\n",

      "\n",
      "“There certainly are circumstances,” said Willoughby, “which might\n",

      "\n",

      "should live in it. How little did I then think that the very first news\n",
      "I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country, would\n",
      "be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate satisfaction\n",
      "and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of prescience of\n",
      "what happiness I should experience from it, can account for. Must it\n",
      "not have been so, Marianne?” speaking to her in a lowered voice. Then\n",
      "continuing his former tone, he said, “And yet this house you would\n",
      "spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary\n",
      "improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first\n",
      "began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us\n",
      "together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance, and\n",
      "every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto\n",

      "and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will always\n",

      "you so dear to me.”\n",

      "two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from\n",

      "her conjecture had been just. So far it was all as she had foreseen;\n",
      "but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her\n",
      "to expect. They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came\n",
      "hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her\n",
      "handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\n",
      "Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had\n",
      "just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning against\n",
      "the mantel-piece with his back towards them. He turned round on their\n",
      "coming in, and his countenance showed that he strongly partook of the\n",
      "emotion which over-powered Marianne.\n",

      "entered—“is she ill?”\n",
      "\n",

      "cousin, by sending me on business to London. I have just received my\n",
      "dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of\n",

      "Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise. Elinor felt equal\n",
      "amazement. For a few moments every one was silent. Mrs. Dashwood first\n",
      "spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you\n",
      "will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here\n",
      "immediately, because you only can judge how far _that_ might be\n",
      "pleasing to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to\n",
      "question your judgment than to doubt your inclination.”\n",

      "such a nature—that—I dare not flatter myself—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped. Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and another\n",
      "pause succeeded. This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faint\n",
      "smile, “It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not torment myself\n",
      "any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible\n",
      "for me now to enjoy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room. They saw him\n",
      "step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the\n",
      "parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this\n",
      "sudden departure occasioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor’s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother’s. She thought of\n",
      "what had just passed with anxiety and distrust. Willoughby’s behaviour\n",
      "in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of\n",
      "cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother’s\n",
      "invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,\n",
      "greatly disturbed her. One moment she feared that no serious design had\n",
      "ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate\n",
      "quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;—the distress in\n",
      "which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could\n",
      "most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne’s\n",
      "love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister’s\n",
      "affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderest\n",
      "compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability\n",
      "not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a\n",
      "duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were\n",
      "red, her countenance was not uncheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,” said she,\n",
      "as she sat down to work, “and with how heavy a heart does he travel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is all very strange. So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work\n",
      "of a moment. And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so\n",
      "affectionate? And now, after only ten minutes notice—Gone too without\n",
      "intending to return!—Something more than what he owned to us must have\n",
      "happened. He did not speak, he did not behave like himself. _You_ must\n",
      "have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be? Can they have\n",
      "quarrelled? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept\n",
      "your invitation here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see\n",
      "_that_. He had not the power of accepting it. I have thought it all\n",
      "over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at\n",
      "first seemed strange to me as well as to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you, indeed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;—but\n",
      "you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can—it will not satisfy _you_,\n",
      "I know; but you shall not talk _me_ out of my trust in it. I am\n",
      "persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapproves\n",
      "of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on that\n",
      "account is eager to get him away;—and that the business which she sends\n",
      "him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him. This is\n",
      "what I believe to have happened. He is, moreover, aware that she _does_\n",
      "disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present confess to\n",
      "her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself obliged, from\n",
      "his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and absent himself\n",
      "from Devonshire for a while. You will tell me, I know, that this may or\n",
      "may _not_ have happened; but I will listen to no cavil, unless you can\n",
      "point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory\n",
      "at this. And now, Elinor, what have you to say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened.\n",
      "Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings! You had rather take\n",
      "evil upon credit than good. You had rather look out for misery for\n",
      "Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the\n",
      "latter. You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave\n",
      "of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown. And is no\n",
      "allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by\n",
      "recent disappointment? Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely\n",
      "because they are not certainties? Is nothing due to the man whom we\n",
      "have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill\n",
      "of? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though\n",
      "unavoidably secret for a while? And, after all, what is it you suspect\n",
      "him of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can hardly tell myself. But suspicion of something unpleasant is the\n",
      "inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in\n",
      "him. There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of the\n",
      "allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be\n",
      "candid in my judgment of every body. Willoughby may undoubtedly have\n",
      "very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.\n",
      "But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at\n",
      "once. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at\n",
      "its being practiced by him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the\n",

      "a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his\n",
      "honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general\n",

      "overpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most\n",

      "when she lay down in it. But the feelings which made such composure a\n",

      "headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;\n",
      "giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding all\n",

      "\n",
      "When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about\n",

      "every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at\n",
      "the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out\n",
      "for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be\n",
      "gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied. She spent\n",
      "whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voice\n",
      "often totally suspended by her tears. In books too, as well as in\n",
      "music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and\n",

      "Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it\n",
      "sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments,\n",

      "No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.\n",

      "direct, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real\n",
      "state of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she\n",
      "could not help suggesting it to her mother.\n",

      "one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of\n",

      "\n",
      "“We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away\n",

      "One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was\n",
      "prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of\n",
      "wandering away by herself. Hitherto she had carefully avoided every\n",
      "companion in her rambles. If her sisters intended to walk on the downs,\n",
      "she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the\n",
      "valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be\n",
      "found when the others set off. But at length she was secured by the\n",
      "exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.\n",
      "They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\n",
      "for Marianne’s _mind_ could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied\n",
      "with gaining one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the\n",
      "entrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less\n",
      "wild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled\n",
      "on first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,\n",
      "they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed\n",
      "the distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had\n",
      "never happened to reach in any of their walks before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one;\n",
      "it was a man on horseback riding towards them. In a few minutes they\n",
      "could distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwards\n",
      "Marianne rapturously exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is he; it is indeed;—I know it is!”—and was hastening to meet him,\n",
      "when Elinor cried out,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken. It is not Willoughby. The\n",
      "person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has, he has,” cried Marianne, “I am sure he has. His air, his coat,\n",
      "his horse. I knew how soon he would come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from\n",
      "particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,\n",
      "quickened her pace and kept up with her. They were soon within thirty\n",
      "yards of the gentleman. Marianne looked again; her heart sunk within\n",
      "her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voices\n",
      "of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well\n",
      "known as Willoughby’s, joined them in begging her to stop, and she\n",
      "turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be\n",
      "forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained a\n",
      "smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on _him_, and in\n",
      "her sister’s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with\n",
      "them to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by\n",
      "Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than\n",
      "even Elinor herself. To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward\n",
      "and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness\n",
      "which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour. On\n",
      "Edward’s side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a\n",
      "lover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He was confused,\n",
      "seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither\n",
      "rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by\n",
      "questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Marianne\n",
      "saw and listened with increasing surprise. She began almost to feel a\n",
      "dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by\n",
      "carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a\n",
      "contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries\n",
      "of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London. No,\n",
      "he had been in Devonshire a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A fortnight!” she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the same\n",
      "county with Elinor without seeing her before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with\n",
      "some friends near Plymouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you been lately in Sussex?” said Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was at Norland about a month ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how does dear, dear Norland look?” cried Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear, dear Norland,” said Elinor, “probably looks much as it always\n",
      "does at this time of the year. The woods and walks thickly covered with\n",
      "dead leaves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” cried Marianne, “with what transporting sensation have I formerly\n",
      "seen them fall! How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven\n",
      "in showers about me by the wind! What feelings have they, the season,\n",
      "the air altogether inspired! Now there is no one to regard them. They\n",
      "are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as\n",
      "possible from the sight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not every one,” said Elinor, “who has your passion for dead\n",
      "leaves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood. But\n",
      "_sometimes_ they are.”—As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a\n",
      "few moments;—but rousing herself again, “Now, Edward,” said she,\n",
      "calling his attention to the prospect, “here is Barton valley. Look up\n",
      "to it, and be tranquil if you can. Look at those hills! Did you ever\n",
      "see their equals? To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and\n",
      "plantations. You may see the end of the house. And there, beneath that\n",
      "farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a beautiful country,” he replied; “but these bottoms must be\n",
      "dirty in winter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because,” replied he, smiling, “among the rest of the objects before\n",
      "me, I see a very dirty lane.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How strange!” said Marianne to herself as she walked on.\n",

      "“Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here? Are the Middletons pleasant\n",
      "people?”\n",
      "\n",

      "situated.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Marianne,” cried her sister, “how can you say so? How can you be so\n",
      "unjust? They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards us\n",
      "have behaved in the friendliest manner. Have you forgot, Marianne, how\n",
      "many pleasant days we have owed to them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Marianne, in a low voice, “nor how many painful moments.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their\n",
      "visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by\n",
      "talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting\n",
      "from him occasional questions and remarks. His coldness and reserve\n",
      "mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to\n",
      "regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, she\n",
      "avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him\n",

      "stand against such a reception. They had begun to fail him before he\n",

      "“As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe. I wish as\n",
      "well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body\n",
      "else it must be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Strange that it would!” cried Marianne. “What have wealth or grandeur\n",
      "to do with happiness?”\n",

      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Elinor, for shame!” said Marianne, “money can only give happiness\n",
      "where there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can\n",
      "afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps,” said Elinor, smiling, “we may come to the same point. _Your_\n",
      "competence and _my_ wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without\n",
      "them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of\n",
      "external comfort must be wanting. Your ideas are only more noble than\n",
      "mine. Come, what is your competence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than _that_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor laughed. “_two_ thousand a year! _one_ is my wealth! I guessed\n",
      "how it would end.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,” said Marianne.\n",
      "“A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller. I am sure I am not\n",
      "extravagant in my demands. A proper establishment of servants, a\n",
      "carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less.”\n",

      "would give us all a large fortune apiece!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh that they would!” cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with\n",
      "animation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary\n",
      "happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,” said Elinor, “in spite\n",
      "of the insufficiency of wealth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear!” cried Margaret, “how happy I should be! I wonder what I\n",
      "should do with it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.\n",
      "\n",

      "“You must begin your improvements on this house,” observed Elinor, “and\n",
      "your difficulties will soon vanish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,” said\n",
      "Edward, “in such an event! What a happy day for booksellers,\n",
      "music-sellers, and print-shops! You, Miss Dashwood, would give a\n",
      "general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you—and as\n",
      "for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music\n",
      "enough in London to content her. And books!—Thomson, Cowper, Scott—she\n",
      "would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up every copy, I\n",
      "believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands; and she would\n",
      "have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.\n",
      "Should not you, Marianne? Forgive me, if I am very saucy. But I was\n",
      "willing to show you that I had not forgot our old disputes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I love to be reminded of the past, Edward—whether it be melancholy or\n",
      "gay, I love to recall it—and you will never offend me by talking of\n",
      "former times. You are very right in supposing how my money would be\n",
      "spent—some of it, at least—my loose cash would certainly be employed in\n",
      "improving my collection of music and books.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the\n",
      "authors or their heirs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who\n",
      "wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever\n",
      "be in love more than once in their life—your opinion on that point is\n",
      "unchanged, I presume?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed. It is\n",
      "not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,” said Elinor, “she is not\n",
      "at all altered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is only grown a little more grave than she was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, Edward,” said Marianne, “_you_ need not reproach me. You are not\n",
      "very gay yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why should you think so!” replied he, with a sigh. “But gaiety never\n",
      "was a part of _my_ character.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor do I think it a part of Marianne’s,” said Elinor; “I should hardly\n",
      "call her a lively girl—she is very earnest, very eager in all she\n",
      "does—sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation—but she is\n",
      "not often really merry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe you are right,” he replied, “and yet I have always set her\n",
      "down as a lively girl.”\n",

      "“I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,” said\n",
      "Elinor, “in a total misapprehension of character in some point or\n",
      "other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or\n",
      "stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the\n",
      "deception originated. Sometimes one is guided by what they say of\n",
      "themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,\n",
      "without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I thought it was right, Elinor,” said Marianne, “to be guided\n",
      "wholly by the opinion of other people. I thought our judgments were\n",
      "given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. This has\n",
      "always been your doctrine, I am sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Marianne, never. My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of\n",
      "the understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the\n",
      "behaviour. You must not confound my meaning. I am guilty, I confess, of\n",
      "having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with\n",
      "greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their\n",
      "sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of\n",

      "\n",
      "“Quite the contrary,” replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My judgment,” he returned, “is all on your side of the question; but I\n",
      "am afraid my practice is much more on your sister’s. I never wish to\n",
      "offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I\n",
      "am only kept back by my natural awkwardness. I have frequently thought\n",
      "that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I\n",
      "am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!”\n",

      "“Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or\n",

      "who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously\n",
      "as herself?”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. His\n",
      "visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own\n",
      "enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. It was evident that he was\n",
      "unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished\n",
      "her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of\n",
      "inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very\n",
      "uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted\n",
      "one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.\n",
      "\n",
      "He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning\n",
      "before the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to\n",
      "promote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to\n",
      "themselves. But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour\n",
      "door open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself\n",
      "come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going into the village to see my horses,” said he, “as you are\n",
      "not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding\n",
      "country; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the\n",
      "valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situation\n",
      "than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had\n",
      "exceedingly pleased him. This was a subject which ensured Marianne’s\n",
      "attention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of\n",
      "these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that had\n",
      "particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, “You\n",
      "must not enquire too far, Marianne—remember I have no knowledge in the\n",
      "picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste\n",
      "if we come to particulars. I shall call hills steep, which ought to be\n",
      "bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and\n",
      "rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be\n",
      "indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere. You must be\n",
      "satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I call it a very\n",
      "fine country—the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,\n",
      "and the valley looks comfortable and snug—with rich meadows and several\n",
      "neat farm houses scattered here and there. It exactly answers my idea\n",
      "of a fine country, because it unites beauty with utility—and I dare say\n",
      "it is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can easily\n",
      "believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brush\n",
      "wood, but these are all lost on me. I know nothing of the picturesque.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid it is but too true,” said Marianne; “but why should you\n",
      "boast of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suspect,” said Elinor, “that to avoid one kind of affectation,\n",
      "Edward here falls into another. Because he believes many people pretend\n",
      "to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel, and\n",
      "is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and\n",
      "less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses. He is\n",
      "fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is very true,” said Marianne, “that admiration of landscape scenery\n",
      "is become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel and tries to\n",
      "describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what\n",
      "picturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I\n",
      "have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to\n",
      "describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and\n",
      "meaning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am convinced,” said Edward, “that you really feel all the delight in\n",
      "a fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your sister\n",
      "must allow me to feel no more than I profess. I like a fine prospect,\n",
      "but not on picturesque principles. I do not like crooked, twisted,\n",
      "blasted trees. I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and\n",
      "flourishing. I do not like ruined, tattered cottages. I am not fond of\n",
      "nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. I have more pleasure in a snug\n",
      "farm-house than a watch-tower—and a troop of tidy, happy villagers\n",
      "please me better than the finest banditti in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her\n",
      "sister. Elinor only laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained\n",
      "thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.\n",
      "She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,\n",
      "his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait\n",
      "of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,” she cried. “Is that\n",
      "Fanny’s hair? I remember her promising to give you some. But I should\n",
      "have thought her hair had been darker.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt—but when she saw\n",
      "how much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thought\n",
      "could not be surpassed by his. He coloured very deeply, and giving a\n",
      "momentary glance at Elinor, replied, “Yes; it is my sister’s hair. The\n",
      "setting always casts a different shade on it, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise. That the hair\n",
      "was her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;\n",
      "the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne\n",
      "considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must\n",
      "have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself. She\n",
      "was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and affecting\n",
      "to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of something\n",
      "else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity\n",
      "of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt, that it\n",
      "was exactly the shade of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward’s embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of\n",
      "mind still more settled. He was particularly grave the whole morning.\n",
      "Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own\n",
      "forgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how little\n",
      "offence it had given her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the\n",
      "cottage, came to take a survey of the guest. With the assistance of his\n",
      "mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of\n",
      "Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery\n",
      "against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of their\n",
      "acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately\n",
      "sprung. But, as it was, she only learned, from some very significant\n",
      "looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret’s instructions,\n",
      "extended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to\n",

      "On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor,\n",
      "towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he wished\n",
      "to engage them for both.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You _must_ drink tea with us to night,” said he, “for we shall be\n",
      "quite alone—and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity. “And who knows but you may raise\n",

      "us again.”\n",
      "\n",

      "was sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave him a brief reply. Marianne’s countenance was more\n",
      "communicative. Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning of\n",
      "others, but such of Marianne’s expressions as had puzzled him before;\n",
      "and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and\n",

      "will like him.”\n",

      "Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on\n",
      "self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment\n",
      "among his friends was at the height. His spirits, during the last two\n",
      "or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved—he grew\n",
      "more and more partial to the house and environs—never spoke of going\n",
      "away without a sigh—declared his time to be wholly disengaged—even\n",
      "doubted to what place he should go when he left them—but still, go he\n",
      "must. Never had any week passed so quickly—he could hardly believe it\n",
      "to be gone. He said so repeatedly; other things he said too, which\n",
      "marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions. He had\n",
      "no pleasure at Norland; he detested being in town; but either to\n",
      "Norland or London, he must go. He valued their kindness beyond any\n",
      "thing, and his greatest happiness was in being with them. Yet, he must\n",
      "leave them at the end of a week, in spite of their wishes and his own,\n",
      "and without any restraint on his time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his\n",
      "mother’s account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose\n",
      "character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse\n",
      "for every thing strange on the part of her son. Disappointed, however,\n",
      "and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain\n",
      "behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regard\n",
      "his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,\n",
      "which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for\n",
      "Willoughby’s service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of openness,\n",
      "and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of\n",
      "independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars’s disposition\n",
      "and designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose\n",
      "in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same\n",
      "inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother. The old\n",
      "well-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child,\n",
      "was the cause of all. She would have been glad to know when these\n",
      "difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,—when Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy. But\n",
      "from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal\n",
      "of her confidence in Edward’s affection, to the remembrance of every\n",
      "mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, and\n",
      "above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round\n",
      "his finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think, Edward,” said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the\n",
      "last morning, “you would be a happier man if you had any profession to\n",
      "engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions. Some\n",
      "inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it—you would\n",
      "not be able to give them so much of your time. But (with a smile) you\n",
      "would be materially benefited in one particular at least—you would know\n",
      "where to go when you left them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do assure you,” he replied, “that I have long thought on this point,\n",
      "as you think now. It has been, and is, and probably will always be a\n",
      "heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage\n",
      "me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like\n",
      "independence. But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my\n",
      "friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. We never\n",
      "could agree in our choice of a profession. I always preferred the\n",
      "church, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family.\n",
      "They recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The\n",
      "law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers\n",
      "in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and\n",
      "drove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for the\n",
      "law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family approved.\n",
      "As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the\n",
      "subject was first started to enter it—and, at length, as there was no\n",
      "necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might be as dashing\n",
      "and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was\n",
      "pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable, and a\n",
      "young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy\n",
      "as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing. I was\n",
      "therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,” said Mrs. Dashwood,\n",
      "“since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons will\n",
      "be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades\n",
      "as Columella’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They will be brought up,” said he, in a serious accent, “to be as\n",
      "unlike myself as is possible. In feeling, in action, in condition, in\n",
      "every thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,\n",
      "Edward. You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike\n",
      "yourself must be happy. But remember that the pain of parting from\n",
      "friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\n",
      "education or state. Know your own happiness. You want nothing but\n",
      "patience—or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope. Your mother\n",
      "will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so anxious for;\n",
      "it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to\n",
      "prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent. How much may\n",
      "not a few months do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think,” replied Edward, “that I may defy many months to produce any\n",
      "good to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which\n",
      "shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor’s\n",
      "feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.\n",
      "But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself\n",
      "from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his\n",
      "going away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by\n",
      "Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by\n",
      "seeking silence, solitude and idleness. Their means were as different\n",
      "as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the\n",
      "house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor\n",
      "avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost as\n",
      "much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this\n",
      "conduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented\n",
      "from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much\n",
      "solicitude on her account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no\n",
      "more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.\n",
      "The business of self-command she settled very easily;—with strong\n",
      "affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.\n",
      "That her sister’s affections _were_ calm, she dared not deny, though\n",
      "she blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave\n",
      "a very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in\n",
      "spite of this mortifying conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in\n",
      "determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to\n",
      "indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\n",
      "to think of Edward, and of Edward’s behaviour, in every possible\n",
      "variety which the different state of her spirits at different times\n",
      "could produce,—with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.\n",
      "There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her\n",
      "mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,\n",
      "conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude was\n",
      "produced. Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could not be\n",
      "chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so\n",
      "interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross\n",
      "her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was\n",
      "roused one morning, soon after Edward’s leaving them, by the arrival of\n",
      "company. She happened to be quite alone. The closing of the little\n",
      "gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew\n",
      "her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the\n",
      "door. Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknown\n",
      "to her. She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir John\n",
      "perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of\n",
      "knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open\n",
      "the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between the\n",
      "door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at one\n",
      "without being heard at the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said he, “we have brought you some strangers. How do you like\n",
      "them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush! they will hear you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind if they do. It is only the Palmers. Charlotte is very\n",
      "pretty, I can tell you. You may see her if you look this way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without\n",
      "taking that liberty, she begged to be excused.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her\n",
      "instrument is open.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is walking, I believe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to\n",
      "wait till the door was opened before she told _her_ story. She came\n",
      "hallooing to the window, “How do you do, my dear? How does Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood do? And where are your sisters? What! all alone! you will be\n",
      "glad of a little company to sit with you. I have brought my other son\n",
      "and daughter to see you. Only think of their coming so suddenly! I\n",
      "thought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,\n",
      "but it never entered my head that it could be them. I thought of\n",
      "nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; so\n",
      "I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel\n",
      "Brandon come back again—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to\n",
      "receive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two\n",
      "strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same\n",
      "time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour,\n",
      "attended by Sir John.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally\n",
      "unlike her in every respect. She was short and plump, had a very pretty\n",
      "face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could\n",
      "possibly be. Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister’s,\n",
      "but they were much more prepossessing. She came in with a smile, smiled\n",
      "all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled when she\n",
      "went away. Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and\n",
      "twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife, but of\n",
      "less willingness to please or be pleased. He entered the room with a\n",
      "look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without\n",
      "speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their\n",
      "apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read\n",
      "it as long as he staid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with a\n",
      "turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before her\n",
      "admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so\n",
      "charming! Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last! I\n",
      "always thought it such a sweet place, ma’am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood)\n",
      "but you have made it so charming! Only look, sister, how delightful\n",
      "every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself! Should not\n",
      "you, Mr. Palmer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from the\n",
      "newspaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Palmer does not hear me,” said she, laughing; “he never does\n",
      "sometimes. It is so ridiculous!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to\n",
      "find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking with\n",
      "surprise at them both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and\n",
      "continued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing\n",
      "their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told. Mrs. Palmer\n",
      "laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every\n",
      "body agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an\n",
      "agreeable surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may believe how glad we all were to see them,” added Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice\n",
      "as if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on\n",
      "different sides of the room; “but, however, I can’t help wishing they\n",
      "had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,\n",
      "for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for\n",
      "you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was\n",
      "wrong in her situation. I wanted her to stay at home and rest this\n",
      "morning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you\n",
      "all!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She expects to be confined in February,” continued Mrs. Jennings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and\n",
      "therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in\n",
      "the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, none at all,” he replied, and read on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here comes Marianne,” cried Sir John. “Now, Palmer, you shall see a\n",
      "monstrous pretty girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and\n",
      "ushered her in himself. Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she\n",
      "appeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so\n",
      "heartily at the question, as to show she understood it. Mr. Palmer\n",
      "looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and\n",
      "then returned to his newspaper. Mrs. Palmer’s eye was now caught by the\n",
      "drawings which hung round the room. She got up to examine them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! dear, how beautiful these are! Well! how delightful! Do but look,\n",
      "mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look at\n",
      "them for ever.” And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot that\n",
      "there were any such things in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down\n",
      "the newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My love, have you been asleep?” said his wife, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the\n",
      "room, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.\n",
      "He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at\n",
      "the park. Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener\n",
      "than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;\n",
      "her daughters might do as they pleased. But they had no curiosity to\n",
      "see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of\n",
      "pleasure from them in any other way. They attempted, therefore,\n",
      "likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not\n",
      "likely to be good. But Sir John would not be satisfied—the carriage\n",
      "should be sent for them and they must come. Lady Middleton too, though\n",
      "she did not press their mother, pressed them. Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.\n",
      "Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a\n",
      "family party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why should they ask us?” said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.\n",
      "“The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very\n",
      "hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying\n",
      "either with them, or with us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,” said Elinor, “by\n",
      "these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a\n",
      "few weeks ago. The alteration is not in them, if their parties are\n",
      "grown tedious and dull. We must look for the change elsewhere.”\n",

      "\n",
      "As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next\n",
      "day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as\n",
      "good humoured and merry as before. She took them all most\n",
      "affectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so glad to see you!” said she, seating herself between Elinor and\n",
      "Marianne, “for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,\n",
      "which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must\n",
      "go, for the Westons come to us next week you know. It was quite a\n",
      "sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the\n",
      "carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I\n",
      "would go with him to Barton. He is so droll! He never tells me any\n",
      "thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again\n",
      "in town very soon, I hope.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not go to town!” cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, “I shall be quite\n",
      "disappointed if you do not. I could get the nicest house in the world\n",
      "for you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. You must come, indeed. I\n",
      "am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am\n",
      "confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.”\n",

      "They thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties.\n",

      "this winter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, began\n",
      "complaining of the weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How horrid all this is!” said he. “Such weather makes every thing and\n",
      "every body disgusting. Dullness is as much produced within doors as\n",
      "without, by rain. It makes one detest all one’s acquaintance. What the\n",
      "devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house?\n",
      "How few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the\n",
      "weather.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the company soon dropt in.\n",

      "\n",
      "Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t be so sly before us,” said Mrs. Palmer; “for we know all\n",
      "about it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think\n",
      "he is extremely handsome. We do not live a great way from him in the\n",
      "country, you know. Not above ten miles, I dare say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much nearer thirty,” said her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, well! there is not much difference. I never was at his house; but\n",
      "they say it is a sweet pretty place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,” said Mr. Palmer.\n",

      "that it could not be done? They dined with us last.”\n",

      "“You and I, Sir John,” said Mrs. Jennings, “should not stand upon such\n",

      "\n",
      "“Then you would be very ill-bred,” cried Mr. Palmer.\n",
      "\n",

      "“Ay, you may abuse me as you please,” said the good-natured old lady,\n",

      "So there I have the whip hand of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid\n",
      "of her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her,\n",
      "as they must live together. It was impossible for any one to be more\n",
      "thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.\n",
      "Palmer. The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her\n",
      "husband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she was\n",
      "highly diverted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Palmer is so droll!” said she, in a whisper, to Elinor. “He is\n",
      "always out of humour.”\n",

      "Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him credit\n",
      "for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he\n",
      "wished to appear. His temper might perhaps be a little soured by\n",
      "finding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable\n",
      "bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly woman—but\n",
      "she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man\n",
      "to be lastingly hurt by it. It was rather a wish of distinction, she\n",
      "believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body, and\n",
      "his general abuse of every thing before him. It was the desire of\n",
      "appearing superior to other people. The motive was too common to be\n",
      "wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by establishing\n",
      "his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to\n",
      "him except his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,” said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, “I have\n",
      "got such a favour to ask of you and your sister. Will you come and\n",
      "spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas? Now, pray do,—and come\n",
      "while the Westons are with us. You cannot think how happy I shall be!\n",
      "It will be quite delightful!—My love,” applying to her husband, “don’t\n",
      "you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” he replied, with a sneer—“I came into Devonshire with no\n",
      "other view.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There now,”—said his lady, “you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you\n",
      "cannot refuse to come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But indeed you must and shall come. I am sure you will like it of all\n",
      "things. The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.\n",
      "You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay\n",
      "now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing\n",
      "against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I\n",
      "never saw before, it is quite charming! But, poor fellow! it is very\n",
      "fatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the\n",
      "hardship of such an obligation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How charming it will be,” said Charlotte, “when he is in\n",
      "Parliament!—won’t it? How I shall laugh! It will be so ridiculous to\n",
      "see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.—But do you know, he\n",
      "says, he will never frank for me? He declares he won’t. Don’t you, Mr.\n",
      "Palmer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He cannot bear writing, you know,” she continued—“he says it is quite\n",
      "shocking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said he, “I never said any thing so irrational. Don’t palm all\n",
      "your abuses of language upon me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There now; you see how droll he is. This is always the way with him!\n",
      "Sometimes he won’t speak to me for half a day together, and then he\n",
      "comes out with something so droll—all about any thing in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,\n",
      "by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” said Elinor; “he seems very agreeable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well—I am so glad you do. I thought you would, he is so pleasant; and\n",
      "Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell\n",
      "you, and you can’t think how disappointed he will be if you don’t come\n",
      "to Cleveland.—I can’t imagine why you should object to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing the\n",
      "subject, put a stop to her entreaties. She thought it probable that as\n",
      "they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some\n",
      "more particular account of Willoughby’s general character, than could\n",
      "be gathered from the Middletons’ partial acquaintance with him; and she\n",
      "was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as\n",
      "might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne. She began by\n",
      "inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whether\n",
      "they were intimately acquainted with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,” replied Mrs. Palmer;—“Not\n",
      "that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.\n",
      "Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was\n",
      "at Allenham. Mama saw him here once before;—but I was with my uncle at\n",
      "Weymouth. However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him\n",
      "in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that we should\n",
      "never have been in the country together. He is very little at Combe, I\n",
      "believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr. Palmer\n",
      "would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, and besides it\n",
      "is such a way off. I know why you inquire about him, very well; your\n",
      "sister is to marry him. I am monstrous glad of it, for then I shall\n",
      "have her for a neighbour you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word,” replied Elinor, “you know much more of the matter than\n",
      "I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talks\n",
      "of. I assure you I heard of it in my way through town.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Mrs. Palmer!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my honour I did.—I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in\n",
      "Bond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You surprise me very much. Colonel Brandon tell you of it! Surely you\n",
      "must be mistaken. To give such intelligence to a person who could not\n",
      "be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should expect\n",
      "Colonel Brandon to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how\n",
      "it happened. When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and so\n",
      "we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and another,\n",
      "and I said to him, ‘So, Colonel, there is a new family come to Barton\n",
      "cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty, and that\n",
      "one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna. Is\n",
      "it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have been in\n",
      "Devonshire so lately.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what did the Colonel say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh—he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true, so\n",
      "from that moment I set it down as certain. It will be quite delightful,\n",
      "I declare! When is it to take place?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but\n",
      "say fine things of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am flattered by his commendation. He seems an excellent man; and I\n",
      "think him uncommonly pleasing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So do I. He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should\n",
      "be so grave and so dull. Mama says _he_ was in love with your sister\n",
      "too. I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly\n",
      "ever falls in love with any body.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?” said\n",
      "Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are\n",
      "acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all\n",
      "think him extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked than\n",
      "Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. She\n",
      "is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he\n",
      "is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and\n",
      "agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her. However, I don’t\n",
      "think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think\n",
      "you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,\n",
      "though we could not get him to own it last night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer’s information respecting Willoughby was not very material;\n",
      "but any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,” continued Charlotte.—“And\n",
      "now I hope we shall always be great friends. You can’t think how much I\n",
      "longed to see you! It is so delightful that you should live at the\n",
      "cottage! Nothing can be like it, to be sure! And I am so glad your\n",
      "sister is going to be well married! I hope you will be a great deal at\n",
      "Combe Magna. It is a sweet place, by all accounts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married. He was a particular\n",
      "friend of Sir John’s. I believe,” she added in a low voice, “he would\n",
      "have been very glad to have had me, if he could. Sir John and Lady\n",
      "Middleton wished it very much. But mama did not think the match good\n",
      "enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the\n",
      "Colonel, and we should have been married immediately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John’s proposal to your mother\n",
      "before it was made? Had he never owned his affection to yourself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have\n",
      "liked it of all things. He had not seen me then above twice, for it was\n",
      "before I left school. However, I am much happier as I am. Mr. Palmer is\n",
      "the kind of man I like.”\n",

      "CHAPTER XXI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families at\n",
      "Barton were again left to entertain each other. But this did not last\n",
      "long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, had\n",
      "hardly done wondering at Charlotte’s being so happy without a cause, at\n",
      "Mr. Palmer’s acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange\n",
      "unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir\n",
      "John’s and Mrs. Jennings’s active zeal in the cause of society,\n",
      "procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a morning’s excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies,\n",
      "whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her\n",
      "relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to\n",
      "the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.\n",
      "Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an\n",
      "invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the\n",
      "return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a\n",
      "visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose\n",
      "elegance,—whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof; for\n",
      "the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for\n",
      "nothing at all. Their being her relations too made it so much the\n",
      "worse; and Mrs. Jennings’s attempts at consolation were therefore\n",
      "unfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about\n",
      "their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\n",
      "up with one another. As it was impossible, however, now to prevent\n",
      "their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with\n",
      "all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merely\n",
      "giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times\n",
      "every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel or\n",
      "unfashionable. Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil,\n",
      "they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,\n",
      "and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady\n",
      "Middleton’s good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had\n",
      "been an hour at the Park. She declared them to be very agreeable girls\n",
      "indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. Sir John’s\n",
      "confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he\n",
      "set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss\n",
      "Steeles’ arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls\n",
      "in the world. From such commendation as this, however, there was not\n",
      "much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the\n",
      "world were to be met with in every part of England, under every\n",
      "possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir John\n",
      "wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his\n",
      "guests. Benevolent, philanthropic man! It was painful to him even to\n",
      "keep a third cousin to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do come now,” said he—“pray come—you must come—I declare you shall\n",
      "come—You can’t think how you will like them. Lucy is monstrous pretty,\n",
      "and so good humoured and agreeable! The children are all hanging about\n",
      "her already, as if she was an old acquaintance. And they both long to\n",
      "see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that you are the\n",
      "most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told them it is all\n",
      "very true, and a great deal more. You will be delighted with them I am\n",
      "sure. They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the\n",
      "children. How can you be so cross as not to come? Why they are your\n",
      "cousins, you know, after a fashion. _You_ are my cousins, and they are\n",
      "my wife’s, so you must be related.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Sir John could not prevail. He could only obtain a promise of their\n",
      "calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in\n",
      "amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their\n",
      "attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the\n",
      "Miss Steeles to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to\n",
      "these young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the\n",
      "eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible\n",
      "face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two or\n",
      "three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her features\n",
      "were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air,\n",
      "which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinction\n",
      "to her person. Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon\n",
      "allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with what\n",
      "constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable\n",
      "to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual raptures,\n",
      "extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their\n",
      "whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate\n",
      "demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of\n",
      "whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing,\n",
      "or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her\n",
      "appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.\n",
      "Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond\n",
      "mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most\n",
      "rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands\n",
      "are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive\n",
      "affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were\n",
      "viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or\n",
      "distrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent\n",
      "encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.\n",
      "She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their\n",
      "work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt\n",
      "no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It suggested no other\n",
      "surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,\n",
      "without claiming a share in what was passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“John is in such spirits today!” said she, on his taking Miss Steeles’s\n",
      "pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window—“He is full of\n",
      "monkey tricks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And soon afterwards, on the second boy’s violently pinching one of the\n",
      "same lady’s fingers, she fondly observed, “How playful William is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And here is my sweet little Annamaria,” she added, tenderly caressing\n",
      "a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the last\n",
      "two minutes; “And she is always so gentle and quiet—Never was there\n",
      "such a quiet little thing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship’s\n",
      "head dress slightly scratching the child’s neck, produced from this\n",
      "pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone\n",
      "by any creature professedly noisy. The mother’s consternation was\n",
      "excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and\n",
      "every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which\n",
      "affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little\n",
      "sufferer. She was seated in her mother’s lap, covered with kisses, her\n",
      "wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was\n",
      "on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by\n",
      "the other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to\n",
      "cease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two\n",
      "brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were\n",
      "ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of\n",
      "similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been\n",
      "successfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly\n",
      "proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of\n",
      "screams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that\n",
      "it would not be rejected. She was carried out of the room therefore in\n",
      "her mother’s arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys chose\n",
      "to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind,\n",
      "the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not\n",
      "known for many hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor little creatures!” said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.\n",
      "“It might have been a very sad accident.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yet I hardly know how,” cried Marianne, “unless it had been under\n",
      "totally different circumstances. But this is the usual way of\n",
      "heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!” said Lucy Steele.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did not\n",
      "feel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the whole\n",
      "task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell. She did\n",
      "her best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton with more\n",
      "warmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And Sir John too,” cried the elder sister, “what a charming man he\n",
      "is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here too, Miss Dashwood’s commendation, being only simple and just,\n",
      "came in without any eclat. She merely observed that he was perfectly\n",
      "good humoured and friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what a charming little family they have! I never saw such fine\n",
      "children in my life.—I declare I quite doat upon them already, and\n",
      "indeed I am always distractedly fond of children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should guess so,” said Elinor, with a smile, “from what I have\n",
      "witnessed this morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have a notion,” said Lucy, “you think the little Middletons rather\n",
      "too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it is\n",
      "so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see children\n",
      "full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and\n",
      "quiet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I confess,” replied Elinor, “that while I am at Barton Park, I never\n",
      "think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss\n",
      "Steele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now\n",
      "said rather abruptly, “And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood? I\n",
      "suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of\n",
      "the manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?” added Miss\n",
      "Steele.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,” said Lucy, who seemed\n",
      "to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think every one _must_ admire it,” replied Elinor, “who ever saw the\n",
      "place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its\n",
      "beauties as we do.”\n",

      "I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was only\n",

      "accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom\n",
      "they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted. And to be\n",
      "better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable\n",
      "lot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,\n",
      "their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of\n",
      "intimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or two\n",
      "together in the same room almost every day. Sir John could do no more;\n",
      "but he did not know that any more was required: to be together was, in\n",
      "his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their\n",
      "meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being established\n",
      "friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their\n",
      "unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew\n",
      "or supposed of his cousins’ situations in the most delicate\n",

      "her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after\n",
      "petty information, or in a disposition to communicate it. The manner in\n",
      "which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it\n",
      "struck her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion of\n",
      "that lady’s knowing, or fancying herself to know something to his\n",

      "Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing; and\n",
      "as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable;\n",
      "but her powers had received no aid from education: she was ignorant and\n",
      "illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement, her want of\n",
      "information in the most common particulars, could not be concealed from\n",
      "Miss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to\n",
      "advantage. Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities\n",
      "which education might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with\n",
      "less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of\n",
      "rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her\n",
      "assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have no\n",
      "lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity\n",
      "with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in\n",
      "conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made\n",
      "every show of attention and deference towards herself perfectly\n",
      "valueless.\n",

      "“You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,” said Lucy to her\n",
      "one day, as they were walking together from the park to the\n",

      "sister-in-law’s mother, Mrs. Ferrars?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor _did_ think the question a very odd one, and her countenance\n",
      "expressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed!” replied Lucy; “I wonder at that, for I thought you must have\n",
      "seen her at Norland sometimes. Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what\n",
      "sort of a woman she is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward’s\n",
      "mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent\n",
      "curiosity; “I know nothing of her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such a\n",
      "way,” said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; “but perhaps\n",
      "there may be reasons—I wish I might venture; but however I hope you\n",
      "will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be\n",
      "impertinent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in\n",
      "silence. It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by\n",
      "saying, with some hesitation,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious. I am sure I\n",
      "would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person\n",
      "whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours. And I am sure I\n",
      "should not have the smallest fear of trusting _you;_ indeed, I should\n",
      "be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable\n",
      "situation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble _you_.\n",
      "I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sorry I do _not_,” said Elinor, in great astonishment, “if it\n",
      "could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her. But really I\n",
      "never understood that you were at all connected with that family, and\n",
      "therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry\n",
      "into her character.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it. But if\n",
      "I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised. Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "is certainly nothing to me at present—but the time _may_ come—how soon\n",
      "it will come must depend upon herself—when we may be very intimately\n",
      "connected.”\n",

      "She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one side\n",
      "glance at her companion to observe its effect on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good heavens!” cried Elinor, “what do you mean? Are you acquainted\n",
      "with Mr. Robert Ferrars? Can you be?” And she did not feel much\n",
      "delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied Lucy, “not to Mr. _Robert_ Ferrars—I never saw him in my\n",
      "life; but,” fixing her eyes upon Elinor, “to his eldest brother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as\n",
      "painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the\n",
      "assertion attended it. She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,\n",
      "unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though\n",
      "her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no\n",
      "danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may well be surprised,” continued Lucy; “for to be sure you could\n",
      "have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the\n",
      "smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always\n",
      "meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so\n",
      "by me to this hour. Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne,\n",
      "and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not felt the\n",
      "greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I really\n",
      "thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained. And I do not think Mr.\n",
      "Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you, because I\n",
      "know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family, and\n",
      "looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own\n",
      "sisters.”—She paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor for a few moments remained silent. Her astonishment at what she\n",
      "heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself\n",
      "to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,\n",
      "which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude—“May I ask\n",
      "if your engagement is of long standing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have been engaged these four years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four years!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did not know,” said she, “that you were even acquainted till the\n",
      "other day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date. He was under my\n",

      "\n",
      "“Your uncle!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; Mr. Pratt. Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I have,” replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which\n",
      "increased with her increase of emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near\n",
      "Plymouth. It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me was\n",
      "often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was\n",
      "formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he\n",
      "was almost always with us afterwards. I was very unwilling to enter\n",
      "into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of\n",
      "his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so\n",
      "prudent as I ought to have been. Though you do not know him so well as\n",
      "me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he\n",
      "is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after\n",
      "a moment’s reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward’s\n",
      "honour and love, and her companion’s falsehood—“Engaged to Mr. Edward\n",
      "Ferrars!—I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,\n",
      "that really—I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake of\n",
      "person or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can mean no other,” cried Lucy, smiling. “Mr. Edward Ferrars, the\n",
      "eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your\n",
      "sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allow\n",
      "that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who\n",
      "all my happiness depends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is strange,” replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, “that I\n",
      "should never have heard him even mention your name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; considering our situation, it was not strange. Our first care has\n",
      "been to keep the matter secret. You knew nothing of me, or my family,\n",
      "and, therefore, there could be no _occasion_ for ever mentioning my\n",
      "name to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister’s\n",
      "suspecting any thing, _that_ was reason enough for his not mentioning\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was silent.—Elinor’s security sunk; but her self-command did not\n",
      "sink with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four years you have been engaged,” said she with a firm voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait. Poor\n",
      "Edward! It puts him quite out of heart.” Then taking a small miniature\n",
      "from her pocket, she added, “To prevent the possibility of mistake, be\n",
      "so good as to look at this face. It does not do him justice, to be\n",
      "sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was\n",
      "drew for.—I have had it above these three years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the\n",
      "painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or\n",
      "her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind, she\n",
      "could have none of its being Edward’s face. She returned it almost\n",
      "instantly, acknowledging the likeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have never been able,” continued Lucy, “to give him my picture in\n",
      "return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so\n",
      "anxious to get it! But I am determined to set for it the very first\n",
      "opportunity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are quite in the right,” replied Elinor calmly. They then\n",
      "proceeded a few paces in silence. Lucy spoke first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure,” said she, “I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully\n",
      "keeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to\n",
      "us, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it,\n",
      "I dare say. I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding\n",
      "proud woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I certainly did not seek your confidence,” said Elinor; “but you do me\n",
      "no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on. Your\n",
      "secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so\n",
      "unnecessary a communication. You must at least have felt that my being\n",
      "acquainted with it could not add to its safety.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover\n",
      "something in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest\n",
      "part of what she had been saying; but Lucy’s countenance suffered no\n",
      "change.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,”\n",
      "said she, “in telling you all this. I have not known you long to be\n",
      "sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by\n",
      "description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as\n",
      "if you was an old acquaintance. Besides in the present case, I really\n",
      "thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular\n",
      "inquiries about Edward’s mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I have\n",
      "not a creature whose advice I can ask. Anne is the only person that\n",
      "knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a\n",
      "great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her\n",
      "betraying me. She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you must\n",
      "perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world\n",
      "t’other day, when Edward’s name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she\n",
      "should out with it all. You can’t think how much I go through in my\n",
      "mind from it altogether. I only wonder that I am alive after what I\n",
      "have suffered for Edward’s sake these last four years. Every thing in\n",
      "such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom—we can hardly\n",
      "meet above twice a-year. I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite\n",
      "broke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very\n",
      "compassionate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes.” continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, “I think whether it\n",
      "would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.” As\n",
      "she said this, she looked directly at her companion. “But then at other\n",
      "times I have not resolution enough for it. I cannot bear the thoughts\n",
      "of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of such a thing\n",
      "would do. And on my own account too—so dear as he is to me—I don’t\n",
      "think I could be equal to it. What would you advise me to do in such a\n",
      "case, Miss Dashwood? What would you do yourself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me,” replied Elinor, startled by the question; “but I can give\n",
      "you no advice under such circumstances. Your own judgment must direct\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure,” continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both\n",
      "sides, “his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor\n",

      "low-spirited when he was at Barton? He was so miserable when he left us\n",

      "“Did he come from your uncle’s, then, when he visited us?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“No,” replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh\n",
      "circumstance in favour of Lucy’s veracity; “I remember he told us, that\n",
      "he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.” She\n",
      "remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothing\n",
      "farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to\n",
      "their names.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?” repeated Lucy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the\n",
      "matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more than\n",
      "a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected. Poor fellow! I am\n",
      "afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretched\n",
      "spirits. I heard from him just before I left Exeter;” taking a letter\n",
      "from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor. “You\n",
      "know his hand, I dare say,—a charming one it is; but that is not\n",
      "written so well as usual. He was tired, I dare say, for he had just\n",
      "filled the sheet to me as full as possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor saw that it _was_ his hand, and she could doubt no longer. This\n",
      "picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been\n",
      "accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward’s gift; but a\n",
      "correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a\n",
      "positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few\n",
      "moments, she was almost overcome—her heart sunk within her, and she\n",
      "could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she\n",
      "struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that\n",
      "her success was speedy, and for the time complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Writing to each other,” said Lucy, returning the letter into her\n",
      "pocket, “is the only comfort we have in such long separations. Yes, _I_\n",
      "have one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even\n",
      "_that_. If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy. I gave him\n",
      "a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, and\n",
      "that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.\n",
      "Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?”\n",

      "“I did,” said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was\n",
      "concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt\n",
      "before. She was mortified, shocked, confounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the\n",
      "conversation could be continued no farther. After sitting with them a\n",
      "few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then\n",

      "However small Elinor’s general dependence on Lucy’s veracity might be,\n",
      "it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the\n",
      "present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of\n",
      "inventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted to\n",

      "as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and\n",
      "contradicted by nothing but her own wishes. Their opportunity of\n",
      "acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest,\n",
      "at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward’s visit near Plymouth,\n",
      "his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects,\n",
      "his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the\n",
      "Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had\n",
      "often surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed\n",
      "altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of\n",
      "condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality\n",
      "could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.—Her resentment of such\n",
      "behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time\n",
      "made her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations,\n",
      "soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her? Had he feigned\n",
      "a regard for her which he did not feel? Was his engagement to Lucy an\n",
      "engagement of the heart? No; whatever it might once have been, she\n",
      "could not believe it such at present. His affection was all her own.\n",
      "She could not be deceived in that. Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had\n",
      "been conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not an illusion\n",
      "of her own vanity. He certainly loved her. What a softener of the heart\n",
      "was this persuasion! How much could it not tempt her to forgive! He had\n",
      "been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first\n",
      "felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he\n",
      "could not be defended; but if he had injured her, how much more had he\n",
      "injured himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His\n",
      "imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have\n",
      "deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise. She might in\n",
      "time regain tranquillity; but _he_, what had he to look forward to?\n",
      "Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his\n",
      "affection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his\n",
      "delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like\n",
      "her—illiterate, artful, and selfish?\n",
      "\n",
      "The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every\n",
      "thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding\n",
      "years—years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the\n",
      "understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,\n",
      "while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society\n",
      "and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity\n",
      "which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficulties\n",
      "from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likely\n",
      "to be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in\n",
      "connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself. These\n",
      "difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might not\n",
      "press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was the state of the\n",
      "person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness,\n",
      "could be felt as a relief!\n",
      "\n",
      "As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she wept\n",
      "for him, more than for herself. Supported by the conviction of having\n",
      "done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the\n",
      "belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thought\n",
      "she could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command\n",
      "herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother\n",
      "and sisters. And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,\n",
      "that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first\n",
      "suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would have\n",
      "supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning\n",
      "in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object\n",
      "of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the\n",
      "perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly\n",
      "possessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove\n",
      "near their house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had been\n",
      "entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to unceasing\n",
      "exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor’s distress. On the contrary it\n",
      "was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would give\n",
      "such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that\n",
      "condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of\n",
      "their partial affection for herself, and which was more than she felt\n",
      "equal to support.\n",
      "\n",
      "From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive\n",
      "no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress,\n",
      "while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their\n",
      "example nor from their praise. She was stronger alone, and her own good\n",
      "sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken, her\n",
      "appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so poignant\n",
      "and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the\n",
      "subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for\n",
      "more reasons than one. She wanted to hear many particulars of their\n",
      "engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what\n",
      "Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her\n",
      "declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to\n",
      "convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her\n",
      "calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in\n",
      "it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary\n",
      "agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least\n",
      "doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very\n",
      "probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her\n",
      "praise, not merely from Lucy’s assertion, but from her venturing to\n",
      "trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so\n",
      "confessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John’s joking\n",
      "intelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor\n",
      "remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by\n",
      "Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it\n",
      "natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very\n",
      "confidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the\n",
      "affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of\n",
      "Lucy’s superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future?\n",
      "She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival’s\n",
      "intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every\n",
      "principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affection\n",
      "for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny\n",
      "herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was\n",
      "unwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on\n",
      "the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own\n",
      "ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be\n",
      "commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take\n",
      "advantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine\n",
      "enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most\n",
      "easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at\n",
      "least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at\n",
      "the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of\n",
      "conversation. Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady\n",
      "Middleton’s head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for\n",
      "a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse. They met for\n",
      "the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,\n",
      "or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording\n",
      "Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at\n",
      "the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they\n",
      "would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to\n",
      "attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,\n",
      "except her mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw a\n",
      "fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this\n",
      "was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\n",
      "and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united\n",
      "them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the\n",
      "invitation; Margaret, with her mother’s permission, was equally\n",
      "compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their\n",
      "parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her\n",
      "seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from\n",
      "the frightful solitude which had threatened her. The insipidity of the\n",
      "meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one\n",
      "novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting\n",
      "than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and\n",
      "drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while\n",
      "they remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility of\n",
      "engaging Lucy’s attention to attempt it. They quitted it only with the\n",
      "removal of the tea-things. The card-table was then placed, and Elinor\n",
      "began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of\n",
      "finding time for conversation at the park. They all rose up in\n",
      "preparation for a round game.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad,” said Lady Middleton to Lucy, “you are not going to finish\n",
      "poor little Annamaria’s basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt\n",
      "your eyes to work filigree by candlelight. And we will make the dear\n",
      "little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then I\n",
      "hope she will not much mind it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,\n",
      "“Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting\n",
      "to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have\n",
      "been at my filigree already. I would not disappoint the little angel\n",
      "for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am\n",
      "resolved to finish the basket after supper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very good, I hope it won’t hurt your eyes—will you ring the\n",
      "bell for some working candles? My poor little girl would be sadly\n",
      "disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for\n",
      "though I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon\n",
      "having it done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an\n",
      "alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no\n",
      "greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others. No one made\n",
      "any objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the forms\n",
      "of general civility, exclaimed, “Your Ladyship will have the goodness\n",
      "to excuse _me_—you know I detest cards. I shall go to the piano-forte;\n",
      "I have not touched it since it was tuned.” And without farther\n",
      "ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that _she_ had never\n",
      "made so rude a speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma’am,”\n",
      "said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; “and I do not\n",
      "much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever\n",
      "heard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining five were now to draw their cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps,” continued Elinor, “if I should happen to cut out, I may be\n",
      "of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and\n",
      "there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be\n",
      "impossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening. I\n",
      "should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help,” cried Lucy,\n",
      "“for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was;\n",
      "and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after\n",
      "all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,” said Miss Steele. “Dear little\n",
      "soul, how I do love her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very kind,” said Lady Middleton to Elinor; “and as you really\n",
      "like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till\n",
      "another rubber, or will you take your chance now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by a\n",
      "little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to\n",
      "practise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same\n",
      "time. Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair\n",
      "rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\n",
      "utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. The pianoforte at\n",
      "which Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had\n",
      "by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,\n",
      "was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might\n",
      "safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,\n",
      "if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its\n",
      "subject. I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you,” cried Lucy warmly, “for breaking the ice; you have set my\n",
      "heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended\n",
      "you by what I told you that Monday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,” and Elinor spoke\n",
      "it with the truest sincerity, “nothing could be farther from my\n",
      "intention than to give you such an idea. Could you have a motive for\n",
      "the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet I do assure you,” replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full of\n",
      "meaning, “there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your\n",
      "manner that made me quite uncomfortable. I felt sure that you was angry\n",
      "with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having\n",
      "took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs. But I am very\n",
      "glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not blame\n",
      "me. If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart\n",
      "speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my\n",
      "life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am\n",
      "sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,\n",
      "to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall\n",
      "never have reason to repent it. Your case is a very unfortunate one;\n",
      "you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have\n",
      "need of all your mutual affection to support you under them. Mr.\n",
      "Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to\n",
      "marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect\n",
      "of more without a sigh. I have been always used to a very small income,\n",
      "and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well to\n",
      "be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that his mother\n",
      "might give him if he married to please her. We must wait, it may be for\n",
      "many years. With almost every other man in the world, it would be an\n",
      "alarming prospect; but Edward’s affection and constancy nothing can\n",
      "deprive me of I know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly\n",
      "supported by the same trust in your’s. If the strength of your\n",
      "reciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under\n",
      "many circumstances it naturally would during a four years’ engagement,\n",
      "your situation would have been pitiable, indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance\n",
      "from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Edward’s love for me,” said Lucy, “has been pretty well put to the\n",
      "test, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and\n",
      "it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt\n",
      "it now. I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment’s alarm\n",
      "on that account from the first.”\n",

      "to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;\n",
      "which I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent not\n",

      "replied, “This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any\n",
      "opinion on the subject had I formed one. It raises my influence much\n",
      "too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too\n",
      "much for an indifferent person.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“’Tis because you are an indifferent person,” said Lucy, with some\n",
      "pique, and laying a particular stress on those words, “that your\n",
      "judgment might justly have such weight with me. If you could be\n",
      "supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your opinion\n",
      "would not be worth having.”\n",

      "nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other\n",
      "less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card table\n",

      "with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and\n",
      "disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a measure\n",
      "only a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happy\n",
      "ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, been\n",
      "overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt\n",
      "of Willoughby’s constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful\n",
      "expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of\n",
      "Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerless\n",
      "her own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she would\n",
      "engage in the solicitude of Marianne’s situation to have the same\n",
      "animating object in view, the same possibility of hope. A short, a very\n",
      "short time however must now decide what Willoughby’s intentions were;\n",
      "in all probability he was already in town. Marianne’s eagerness to be\n",
      "gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor was\n",
      "resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character\n",
      "which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,\n",
      "but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such\n",
      "zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant,\n",
      "before many meetings had taken place. Should the result of her\n",
      "observations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to open\n",
      "the eyes of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions would be\n",
      "of a different nature—she must then learn to avoid every selfish\n",
      "comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction\n",
      "in the happiness of Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were three days on their journey, and Marianne’s behaviour as they\n",
      "travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and\n",
      "companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat in\n",
      "silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely\n",
      "ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty\n",
      "within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively\n",
      "addressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor\n",
      "took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had\n",
      "assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever she\n",
      "could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all\n",
      "possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and\n",
      "enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their\n",
      "own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring\n",
      "salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They reached town by\n",
      "three o’clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey,\n",
      "from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury\n",
      "of a good fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies\n",
      "were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment. It\n",
      "had formerly been Charlotte’s, and over the mantelpiece still hung a\n",
      "landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her having\n",
      "spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their\n",
      "arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her\n",
      "mother, and sat down for that purpose. In a few moments Marianne did\n",
      "the same. “_I_ am writing home, Marianne,” said Elinor; “had not you\n",
      "better defer your letter for a day or two?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am _not_ going to write to my mother,” replied Marianne, hastily,\n",
      "and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more; it\n",
      "immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; and\n",
      "the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however\n",
      "mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be\n",
      "engaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her\n",
      "pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\n",
      "Marianne’s was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no\n",
      "more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with\n",
      "eager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the\n",
      "direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the\n",
      "bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed\n",
      "for her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them\n",
      "which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this\n",
      "agitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely eat any\n",
      "dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed\n",
      "anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much\n",
      "engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing. The tea\n",
      "things were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more\n",
      "than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly\n",
      "heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor\n",
      "felt secure of its announcing Willoughby’s approach, and Marianne,\n",
      "starting up, moved towards the door. Every thing was silent; this could\n",
      "not be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a few steps\n",
      "towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned into\n",
      "the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him\n",
      "would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant\n",
      "she could not help exclaiming, “Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it\n",
      "is!” and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when\n",
      "Colonel Brandon appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediately\n",
      "left the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her\n",
      "regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she felt\n",
      "particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive\n",
      "that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing\n",
      "him. She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even\n",
      "observed Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and\n",
      "concern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded\n",
      "towards herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is your sister ill?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of\n",
      "head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which\n",
      "she could decently attribute her sister’s behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect\n",
      "himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of\n",
      "his pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about\n",
      "their journey, and the friends they had left behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,\n",
      "they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts\n",
      "of both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whether\n",
      "Willoughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by\n",
      "any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying something,\n",
      "she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last.\n",
      "“Yes,” he replied, with some embarrassment, “almost ever since; I have\n",
      "been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in\n",
      "my power to return to Barton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to\n",
      "her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with\n",
      "the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and she\n",
      "was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the\n",
      "subject than she had ever felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings soon came in. “Oh! Colonel,” said she, with her usual\n",
      "noisy cheerfulness, “I am monstrous glad to see you—sorry I could not\n",
      "come before—beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a\n",
      "little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been\n",
      "at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do\n",
      "after one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright to\n",
      "settle with. Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner! But\n",
      "pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town\n",
      "today?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer’s, where I have been\n",
      "dining.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house? How does\n",
      "Charlotte do? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,\n",
      "that you will certainly see her to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, to be sure, I thought as much. Well, Colonel, I have brought two\n",
      "young ladies with me, you see—that is, you see but one of them now, but\n",
      "there is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too—which you\n",
      "will not be sorry to hear. I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "will do between you about her. Ay, it is a fine thing to be young and\n",
      "handsome. Well! I was young once, but I never was very handsome—worse\n",
      "luck for me. However, I got a very good husband, and I don’t know what\n",
      "the greatest beauty can do more. Ah! poor man! he has been dead these\n",
      "eight years and better. But Colonel, where have you been to since we\n",
      "parted? And how does your business go on? Come, come, let’s have no\n",
      "secrets among friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but\n",
      "without satisfying her in any. Elinor now began to make the tea, and\n",
      "Marianne was obliged to appear again.\n",
      "\n",
      "After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent\n",
      "than he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to\n",
      "stay long. No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were\n",
      "unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.\n",
      "The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the\n",
      "expectation of what was to happen that day. They had not long finished\n",
      "their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer’s barouche stopped at the door, and\n",
      "in a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see\n",
      "them all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure\n",
      "from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again. So surprised at\n",
      "their coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all\n",
      "along; so angry at their accepting her mother’s invitation after having\n",
      "declined her own, though at the same time she would never have forgiven\n",
      "them if they had not come!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,” said she; “What do you think\n",
      "he said when he heard of your coming with Mama? I forget what it was\n",
      "now, but it was something so droll!”\n",
      "\n",
      "After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,\n",
      "or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their\n",
      "acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings’s side, and in laughter without cause on\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer’s, it was proposed by the latter that they should all\n",
      "accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to\n",
      "which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise\n",
      "some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it at\n",
      "first was induced to go likewise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch. In Bond\n",
      "Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in\n",
      "constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind\n",
      "was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all\n",
      "that interested and occupied the others. Restless and dissatisfied\n",
      "every where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article\n",
      "of purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she received\n",
      "no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at home again, and\n",
      "could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs.\n",
      "Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing pretty, expensive, or new;\n",
      "who was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her\n",
      "time in rapture and indecision.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner had\n",
      "they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and when\n",
      "Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful\n",
      "countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?” said she to\n",
      "the footman who then entered with the parcels. She was answered in the\n",
      "negative. “Are you quite sure of it?” she replied. “Are you certain\n",
      "that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man replied that none had.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How very odd!” said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she\n",
      "turned away to the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How odd, indeed!” repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her sister\n",
      "with uneasiness. “If she had not known him to be in town she would not\n",
      "have written to him, as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;\n",
      "and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come nor write!\n",
      "Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagement\n",
      "between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on in\n",
      "so doubtful, so mysterious a manner! _I_ long to inquire; and how will\n",
      "_my_ interference be borne.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continued\n",
      "many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would represent in\n",
      "the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious\n",
      "enquiry into the affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings’s intimate\n",
      "acquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with\n",
      "them. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening\n",
      "engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\n",
      "for the others. Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she would\n",
      "never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her own\n",
      "disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to\n",
      "her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation\n",
      "and the pain of disappointment. She sometimes endeavoured for a few\n",
      "minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she returned\n",
      "to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards\n",
      "across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window,\n",
      "in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“If this open weather holds much longer,” said Mrs. Jennings, when they\n",
      "met at breakfast the following morning, “Sir John will not like leaving\n",
      "Barton next week; ’tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day’s\n",
      "pleasure. Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem to\n",
      "take it so much to heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to the\n",
      "window as she spoke, to examine the day. “I had not thought of _that_.\n",
      "This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it.\n",
      "“It is charming weather for _them_ indeed,” she continued, as she sat\n",
      "down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance. “How much they\n",
      "must enjoy it! But” (with a little return of anxiety) “it cannot be\n",
      "expected to last long. At this time of the year, and after such a\n",
      "series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. Frosts\n",
      "will soon set in, and in all probability with severity. In another day\n",
      "or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer—nay,\n",
      "perhaps it may freeze tonight!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At any rate,” said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from\n",
      "seeing her sister’s thoughts as clearly as she did, “I dare say we\n",
      "shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next\n",
      "week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, my dear, I’ll warrant you we do. Mary always has her own way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now,” silently conjectured Elinor, “she will write to Combe by\n",
      "this day’s post.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But if she _did_, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy\n",
      "which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact. Whatever the\n",
      "truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough\n",
      "contentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could\n",
      "not be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in spirits; happy\n",
      "in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation of\n",
      "a frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings’s acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; and\n",
      "Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,\n",
      "watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the\n",
      "air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There\n",
      "seems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm\n",
      "even in my muff. It was not so yesterday, I think. The clouds seem\n",
      "parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear\n",
      "afternoon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,\n",
      "and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning in\n",
      "the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching\n",
      "frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings’s style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her\n",
      "behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. Every thing in her\n",
      "household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and\n",
      "excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton’s regret, she\n",
      "had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could at\n",
      "all discompose the feelings of her young companions. Pleased to find\n",
      "herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had\n",
      "expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real\n",
      "enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or\n",
      "abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with\n",
      "them almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,\n",
      "who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from\n",
      "any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much\n",
      "concern his continued regard for her sister. She feared it was a\n",
      "strengthening regard. It grieved her to see the earnestness with which\n",
      "he often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than\n",
      "when at Barton.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby was\n",
      "also arrived. His card was on the table when they came in from the\n",
      "morning’s drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God!” cried Marianne, “he has been here while we were out.”\n",
      "Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured to\n",
      "say, “Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow.” But Marianne seemed\n",
      "hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings’s entrance, escaped with the\n",
      "precious card.\n",
      "\n",
      "This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of\n",
      "her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. From this\n",
      "moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every\n",
      "hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing. She insisted on being\n",
      "left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor’s thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street\n",
      "during their absence; but a moment’s glance at her sister when they\n",
      "returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second\n",
      "visit there. A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For me!” cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, ma’am, for my mistress.”\n",

      "silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, a little—not much.”\n",

      "“Me!” returned Elinor in some confusion; “indeed, Marianne, I have\n",
      "nothing to tell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor I,” answered Marianne with energy, “our situations then are alike.\n",
      "We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do not\n",
      "communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she was\n",
      "not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to\n",
      "press for greater openness in Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it\n",
      "aloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit\n",
      "Street the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and\n",
      "cousins the following evening. Business on Sir John’s part, and a\n",
      "violent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.\n",
      "The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew\n",
      "near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that\n",
      "they should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some difficulty\n",
      "in persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen nothing of\n",
      "Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad,\n",
      "than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not\n",
      "materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled\n",
      "in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\n",
      "young people, and to amuse them with a ball. This was an affair,\n",
      "however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. In the country, an\n",
      "unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the\n",
      "reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it\n",
      "was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it\n",
      "known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine\n",
      "couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had\n",
      "not seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoid\n",
      "the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and therefore\n",
      "never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on their\n",
      "entrance. He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who they\n",
      "were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the\n",
      "room. Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: it\n",
      "was enough—_he_ was not there—and she sat down, equally ill-disposed to\n",
      "receive or communicate pleasure. After they had been assembled about an\n",
      "hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his\n",
      "surprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first\n",
      "informed of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said\n",
      "something very droll on hearing that they were to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you were both in Devonshire,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you?” replied Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When do you go back again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know.” And thus ended their discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was\n",
      "that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise. She\n",
      "complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, aye,” said Mrs. Jennings, “we know the reason of all that very\n",
      "well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you\n",
      "would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very\n",
      "pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Invited!” cried Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him\n",
      "somewhere in the street this morning.” Marianne said no more, but\n",
      "looked exceedingly hurt. Impatient in this situation to be doing\n",
      "something that might lead to her sister’s relief, Elinor resolved to\n",
      "write the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears\n",
      "for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been\n",
      "so long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by\n",
      "perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again\n",
      "writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other\n",
      "person.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on\n",
      "business, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too\n",
      "restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one\n",
      "window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.\n",
      "Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all\n",
      "that had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby’s inconstancy, urging her\n",
      "by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account\n",
      "of her real situation with respect to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and\n",
      "Colonel Brandon was announced. Marianne, who had seen him from the\n",
      "window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he\n",
      "entered it. He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\n",
      "satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in\n",
      "particular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.\n",
      "Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her\n",
      "sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening. It was not the\n",
      "first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than\n",
      "once before, beginning with the observation of “your sister looks\n",
      "unwell to-day,” or “your sister seems out of spirits,” he had appeared\n",
      "on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, something\n",
      "particular about her. After a pause of several minutes, their silence\n",
      "was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was\n",
      "to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother? Elinor was not\n",
      "prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged\n",
      "to adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he meant? He\n",
      "tried to smile as he replied, “your sister’s engagement to Mr.\n",
      "Willoughby is very generally known.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It cannot be generally known,” returned Elinor, “for her own family do\n",
      "not know it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked surprised and said, “I beg your pardon, I am afraid my\n",
      "inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy\n",
      "intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally\n",
      "talked of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By many—by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you are\n",
      "most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. But\n",
      "still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps\n",
      "rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to\n",
      "support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,\n",
      "accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in\n",
      "your sister’s writing. I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I\n",
      "could ask the question. Is every thing finally settled? Is it\n",
      "impossible to—? But I have no right, and I could have no chance of\n",
      "succeeding. Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. I believe I have been wrong in\n",
      "saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I\n",
      "have the strongest dependence. Tell me that it is all absolutely\n",
      "resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if\n",
      "concealment be possible, is all that remains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for\n",
      "her sister, affected her very much. She was not immediately able to say\n",
      "anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated for a\n",
      "short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give. The real\n",
      "state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known\n",
      "to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as liable\n",
      "to say too much as too little. Yet as she was convinced that Marianne’s\n",
      "affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon’s\n",
      "success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and at the same\n",
      "time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she thought it most\n",
      "prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more than she really\n",
      "knew or believed. She acknowledged, therefore, that though she had\n",
      "never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with\n",
      "each other, of their mutual affection she had no doubt, and of their\n",
      "correspondence she was not astonished to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak,\n",
      "rose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,\n",
      "“to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he\n",
      "may endeavour to deserve her,”—took leave, and went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to\n",
      "lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on the\n",
      "contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon’s\n",

      "\n",
      "Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor\n",
      "regret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughby\n",
      "neither came nor wrote. They were engaged about the end of that time to\n",
      "attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept\n",
      "away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this party,\n",
      "Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and seeming\n",
      "equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared, without one\n",
      "look of hope or one expression of pleasure. She sat by the drawing-room\n",
      "fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton’s arrival, without\n",
      "once stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude, lost in her own\n",
      "thoughts, and insensible of her sister’s presence; and when at last\n",
      "they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door, she\n",
      "started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as\n",
      "the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended the\n",
      "stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to another\n",
      "in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite full\n",
      "of company, and insufferably hot. When they had paid their tribute of\n",
      "politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted\n",
      "to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and\n",
      "inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. After some\n",
      "time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to\n",
      "Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and\n",
      "Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great\n",
      "distance from the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived\n",
      "Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest\n",
      "conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman. She soon\n",
      "caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to\n",
      "speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;\n",
      "and then continued his discourse with the same lady. Elinor turned\n",
      "involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by\n",
      "her. At that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenance\n",
      "glowing with sudden delight, she would have moved towards him\n",
      "instantly, had not her sister caught hold of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good heavens!” she exclaimed, “he is there—he is there—Oh! why does he\n",
      "not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray, pray be composed,” cried Elinor, “and do not betray what you\n",
      "feel to every body present. Perhaps he has not observed you yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This however was more than she could believe herself; and to be\n",
      "composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne, it\n",
      "was beyond her wish. She sat in an agony of impatience which affected\n",
      "every feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up,\n",
      "and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to\n",
      "him. He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than\n",
      "Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to observe\n",
      "her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and\n",
      "asked how long they had been in town. Elinor was robbed of all presence\n",
      "of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word. But the\n",
      "feelings of her sister were instantly expressed. Her face was crimsoned\n",
      "over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion, “Good God!\n",
      "Willoughby, what is the meaning of this? Have you not received my\n",
      "letters? Will you not shake hands with me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and he\n",
      "held her hand only for a moment. During all this time he was evidently\n",
      "struggling for composure. Elinor watched his countenance and saw its\n",
      "expression becoming more tranquil. After a moment’s pause, he spoke\n",
      "with calmness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,\n",
      "and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find\n",
      "yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home. My card was not lost, I hope.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But have you not received my notes?” cried Marianne in the wildest\n",
      "anxiety. “Here is some mistake I am sure—some dreadful mistake. What\n",
      "can be the meaning of it? Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven’s sake tell\n",
      "me, what is the matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment\n",
      "returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he\n",
      "had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion,\n",
      "he recovered himself again, and after saying, “Yes, I had the pleasure\n",
      "of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so\n",
      "good as to send me,” turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined\n",
      "his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into\n",
      "her chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried\n",
      "to screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with\n",
      "lavender water.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go to him, Elinor,” she cried, as soon as she could speak, “and force\n",
      "him to come to me. Tell him I must see him again—must speak to him\n",
      "instantly.—I cannot rest—I shall not have a moment’s peace till this is\n",
      "explained—some dreadful misapprehension or other. Oh, go to him this\n",
      "moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait. This is\n",
      "not the place for explanations. Wait only till tomorrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him\n",
      "herself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at least,\n",
      "with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him with more\n",
      "privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued\n",
      "incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings,\n",
      "by exclamations of wretchedness. In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby\n",
      "quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne\n",
      "that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that\n",
      "evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm. She instantly begged\n",
      "her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she was\n",
      "too miserable to stay a minute longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed\n",
      "that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her\n",
      "wish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they\n",
      "departed as soon as the carriage could be found. Scarcely a word was\n",
      "spoken during their return to Berkeley Street. Marianne was in a silent\n",
      "agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was\n",
      "luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room, where\n",
      "hartshorn restored her a little to herself. She was soon undressed and\n",
      "in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her sister then left\n",
      "her, and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure\n",
      "enough for thinking over the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and\n",
      "Marianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,\n",
      "seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her own\n",
      "wishes, _she_ could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or\n",
      "misapprehension of any kind. Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment\n",
      "could account for it. Her indignation would have been still stronger\n",
      "than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to\n",
      "speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented her from\n",
      "believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the\n",
      "affections of her sister from the first, without any design that would\n",
      "bear investigation. Absence might have weakened his regard, and\n",
      "convenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a\n",
      "regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already\n",
      "have given her, and on those still more severe which might await her in\n",
      "its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest\n",
      "concern. Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she\n",
      "could _esteem_ Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided in\n",
      "future, her mind might be always supported. But every circumstance that\n",
      "could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of\n",

      "\n",
      "Before the housemaid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun gained\n",
      "any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne, only half\n",
      "dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sake of\n",
      "all the little light she could command from it, and writing as fast as\n",
      "a continual flow of tears would permit her. In this situation, Elinor,\n",
      "roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first perceived her; and\n",
      "after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a\n",
      "tone of the most considerate gentleness,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Marianne, may I ask—?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Elinor,” she replied, “ask nothing; you will soon know all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no\n",
      "longer than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return\n",
      "of the same excessive affliction. It was some minutes before she could\n",
      "go on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still\n",
      "obliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of\n",
      "her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the\n",
      "last time to Willoughby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power; and\n",
      "she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had not\n",
      "Marianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous\n",
      "irritability, not to speak to her for the world. In such circumstances,\n",
      "it was better for both that they should not be long together; and the\n",
      "restless state of Marianne’s mind not only prevented her from remaining\n",
      "in the room a moment after she was dressed, but requiring at once\n",
      "solitude and continual change of place, made her wander about the house\n",
      "till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of every body.\n",
      "\n",
      "At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and\n",
      "Elinor’s attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not in\n",
      "pitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to\n",
      "engage Mrs. Jennings’s notice entirely to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a\n",
      "considerable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,\n",
      "round the common working table, when a letter was delivered to\n",
      "Marianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a\n",

      "hardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremour as\n",
      "made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings’s notice. That good\n",
      "lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from\n",
      "Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she\n",

      "been carried on for months and months, as it might have been, before he\n",

      "of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding, and most severely\n",
      "condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she had finished\n",

      "\n",
      "Elinor would not contend, and only replied, “Whoever may have been so\n",
      "detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,\n",
      "my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own\n",

      "\n",

      "hysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at\n",
      "all, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for\n",
      "assistance. Some lavender drops, however, which she was at length\n",
      "persuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings\n",

      "Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and without\n",
      "waiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the door and\n",
      "walked in with a look of real concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you do my dear?”—said she in a voice of great compassion to\n",
      "Marianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How is she, Miss Dashwood? Poor thing! she looks very bad. No wonder.\n",
      "Ay, it is but too true. He is to be married very soon—a\n",
      "good-for-nothing fellow! I have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylor told\n",
      "me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular friend\n",
      "of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it; and\n",
      "I was almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I can say is,\n",
      "that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance\n",
      "abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his\n",
      "heart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it. I\n",
      "have no notion of men’s going on in this way; and if ever I meet him\n",
      "again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a\n",
      "day. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the\n",
      "only young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face you\n",
      "will never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won’t disturb her any\n",
      "longer, for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with.\n",
      "The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know, and that\n",
      "will amuse her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she\n",
      "supposed her young friend’s affliction could be increased by noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with\n",
      "them. Elinor even advised her against it. But “no, she would go down;\n",
      "she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less.”\n",
      "Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,\n",
      "though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,\n",
      "said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,\n",
      "while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into\n",
      "the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmer\n",
      "than her sister had expected. Had she tried to speak, or had she been\n",
      "conscious of half Mrs. Jennings’s well-meant but ill-judged attentions\n",
      "to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but not a\n",
      "syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts\n",
      "preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings’s kindness, though its\n",
      "effusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, made\n",
      "her those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities, which her\n",
      "sister could not make or return for herself. Their good friend saw that\n",
      "Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to her which\n",
      "might make her at all less so. She treated her therefore, with all the\n",
      "indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last\n",
      "day of its holidays. Marianne was to have the best place by the fire,\n",
      "was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to be\n",
      "amused by the relation of all the news of the day. Had not Elinor, in\n",
      "the sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, she could\n",
      "have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings’s endeavours to cure a\n",
      "disappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a\n",
      "good fire. As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was\n",
      "forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could stay no longer.\n",
      "With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not to\n",
      "follow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor soul!” cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, “how it\n",
      "grieves me to see her! And I declare if she is not gone away without\n",
      "finishing her wine! And the dried cherries too! Lord! nothing seems to\n",
      "do her any good. I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I\n",
      "would send all over the town for it. Well, it is the oddest thing to\n",
      "me, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there is\n",
      "plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless\n",
      "you! they care no more about such things!—”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Fifty thousand pounds, my dear. Did you ever see her? a smart, stylish\n",
      "girl they say, but not handsome. I remember her aunt very well, Biddy\n",
      "Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man. But the family are all rich\n",
      "together. Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won’t come\n",
      "before it’s wanted; for they say he is all to pieces. No wonder!\n",
      "dashing about with his curricle and hunters! Well, it don’t signify\n",
      "talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes love to\n",
      "a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to fly off\n",
      "from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is ready to\n",
      "have him. Why don’t he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house,\n",
      "turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I warrant\n",
      "you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came\n",
      "round. But that won’t do now-a-days; nothing in the way of pleasure can\n",
      "ever be given up by the young men of this age.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is? Is she said to be\n",
      "amiable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her\n",
      "mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day\n",
      "Miss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would\n",
      "not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could\n",
      "never agree.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who are the Ellisons?”\n",

      "“Her guardians, my dear. But now she is of age and may choose for\n",
      "herself; and a pretty choice she has made!—What now,” after pausing a\n",
      "moment—“your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan by\n",
      "herself. Is there nothing one can get to comfort her? Poor dear, it\n",
      "seems quite cruel to let her be alone. Well, by-and-by we shall have a\n",
      "few friends, and that will amuse her a little. What shall we play at?\n",
      "She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear ma’am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. Marianne, I dare say,\n",
      "will not leave her room again this evening. I shall persuade her if I\n",
      "can to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, I believe that will be best for her. Let her name her own supper,\n",

      "down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been hanging\n",
      "over her head as long as that. And so the letter that came today\n",
      "finished it! Poor soul! I am sure if I had had a notion of it, I would\n",
      "not have joked her about it for all my money. But then you know, how\n",
      "should I guess such a thing? I made sure of its being nothing but a\n",
      "common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at\n",
      "about them. Lord! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when\n",
      "they hear it! If I had my senses about me I might have called in\n",
      "Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it. But I shall see\n",
      "them tomorrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and\n",
      "Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest\n",
      "allusion to what has passed, before my sister. Their own good-nature\n",
      "must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing\n",
      "about it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to\n",
      "myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my\n",
      "dear madam will easily believe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed. It must be terrible for you to hear\n",
      "it talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a\n",
      "word about it to her for the world. You saw I did not all dinner time.\n",
      "No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very\n",
      "thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I\n",
      "certainly will. For my part, I think the less that is said about such\n",
      "things, the better, the sooner ’tis blown over and forgot. And what\n",
      "good does talking ever do you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many cases\n",
      "of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances which, for\n",
      "the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become the\n",
      "public conversation. I must do _this_ justice to Mr. Willoughby—he has\n",
      "broken no positive engagement with my sister.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Law, my dear! Don’t pretend to defend him. No positive engagement\n",
      "indeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the\n",
      "very rooms they were to live in hereafter!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, for her sister’s sake, could not press the subject farther, and\n",
      "she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby’s; since, though\n",
      "Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the enforcement\n",
      "of the real truth. After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, my dear, ’tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will be\n",
      "all the better for Colonel Brandon. He will have her at last; aye, that\n",
      "he will. Mind me, now, if they an’t married by Mid-summer. Lord! how\n",
      "he’ll chuckle over this news! I hope he will come tonight. It will be\n",
      "all to one a better match for your sister. Two thousand a year without\n",
      "debt or drawback—except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had\n",
      "forgot her; but she may be ’prenticed out at a small cost, and then\n",
      "what does it signify? Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you; exactly\n",
      "what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and\n",
      "conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered\n",
      "with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in\n",
      "one corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were\n",
      "there! Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a\n",
      "very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;\n",
      "and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile\n",
      "from the turnpike-road, so ’tis never dull, for if you only go and sit\n",
      "up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages\n",
      "that pass along. Oh! ’tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in the\n",
      "village, and the parsonage-house within a stone’s throw. To my fancy, a\n",
      "thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to send\n",
      "three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than your\n",
      "mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can. One\n",
      "shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we _can_ but put\n",
      "Willoughby out of her head!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, if we can do _that_, Ma’am,” said Elinor, “we shall do very well\n",
      "with or without Colonel Brandon.” And then rising, she went away to\n",
      "join Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room,\n",
      "leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,\n",
      "till Elinor’s entrance, had been her only light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had better leave me,” was all the notice that her sister received\n",
      "from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will leave you,” said Elinor, “if you will go to bed.” But this,\n",
      "from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first\n",
      "refused to do. Her sister’s earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,\n",
      "soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her aching head\n",
      "on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some quiet rest before\n",
      "she left her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear,” said she, entering, “I have just recollected that I have\n",
      "some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was\n",
      "tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister. My poor\n",
      "husband! how fond he was of it! Whenever he had a touch of his old\n",
      "colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the\n",
      "world. Do take it to your sister.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Ma’am,” replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the\n",
      "complaints for which it was recommended, “how good you are! But I have\n",
      "just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think\n",
      "nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me\n",
      "leave, I will drink the wine myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes\n",
      "earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she\n",
      "swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a\n",
      "colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healing\n",
      "powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself\n",
      "as on her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner\n",
      "of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that\n",
      "he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he\n",
      "was already aware of what occasioned her absence. Mrs. Jennings was not\n",
      "struck by the same thought; for soon after his entrance, she walked\n",
      "across the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered,\n",
      "“The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see. He knows nothing of it; do\n",
      "tell him, my dear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look\n",
      "which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after her\n",
      "sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Marianne is not well,” said she. “She has been indisposed all day, and\n",
      "we have persuaded her to go to bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps, then,” he hesitatingly replied, “what I heard this morning\n",
      "may be—there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at\n",
      "first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think—in short, that a man,\n",
      "whom I _knew_ to be engaged—but how shall I tell you? If you know it\n",
      "already, as surely you must, I may be spared.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean,” answered Elinor, with forced calmness, “Mr. Willoughby’s\n",
      "marriage with Miss Grey. Yes, we _do_ know it all. This seems to have\n",
      "been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded\n",
      "it to us. Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a stationer’s shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. Two ladies\n",
      "were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other\n",
      "an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting\n",
      "concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The name of\n",
      "Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my\n",
      "attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing\n",
      "was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey—it was\n",
      "no longer to be a secret—it would take place even within a few weeks,\n",
      "with many particulars of preparations and other matters. One thing,\n",
      "especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still\n",
      "more:—as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe Magna,\n",
      "his seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment!—but it would be impossible\n",
      "to describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt, on inquiry,\n",
      "for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and\n",
      "that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey’s\n",
      "guardian.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand\n",
      "pounds? In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It may be so; but Willoughby is capable—at least I think”—he stopped a\n",
      "moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, “And\n",
      "your sister—how did she—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her sufferings have been very severe. I have only to hope that they\n",
      "may be proportionately short. It has been, it is a most cruel\n",
      "affliction. Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard;\n",
      "and even now, perhaps—but _I_ am almost convinced that he never was\n",
      "really attached to her. He has been very deceitful! and, in some\n",
      "points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” said Colonel Brandon, “there is, indeed! But your sister does\n",
      "not—I think you said so—she does not consider quite as you do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still\n",
      "justify him if she could.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the\n",
      "tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was\n",
      "necessarily dropped. Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure\n",
      "while they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss\n",
      "Dashwood’s communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel\n",
      "Brandon’s side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of\n",
      "hope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening\n",
      "more serious and thoughtful than usual.\n",

      "From a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the\n",
      "next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had\n",
      "closed her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt; and\n",
      "before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and\n",
      "again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on\n",
      "Elinor’s side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on\n",
      "Marianne’s, as before. Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as\n",
      "unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every\n",
      "consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him. At one moment she\n",
      "was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at\n",
      "another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third\n",
      "could resist it with energy. In one thing, however, she was uniform,\n",
      "when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, the\n",
      "presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obliged to\n",
      "endure it. Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings’s\n",
      "entering into her sorrows with any compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, no, it cannot be,” she cried; “she cannot feel. Her kindness\n",
      "is not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness. All that she wants\n",
      "is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her\n",
      "sister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable\n",
      "refinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her\n",
      "on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished\n",
      "manner. Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there be\n",
      "that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an\n",
      "excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid. She expected\n",
      "from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she\n",
      "judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on\n",
      "herself. Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together\n",

      "calm enough to read it, brought little comfort. Willoughby filled every\n",

      "warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by Elinor’s\n",
      "application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them\n",
      "both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection for\n",

      "unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be\n",
      "in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except of\n",

      "Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy\n",
      "till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself;\n",
      "and positively refusing Elinor’s offered attendance, went out alone for\n",
      "the rest of the morning. Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the\n",
      "pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne’s\n",
      "letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then\n",
      "sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat\n",
      "her directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the\n",
      "drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings’s going away, remained fixed at the table\n",
      "where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over\n",
      "her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly\n",
      "over its effect on her mother.\n",

      "In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when\n",

      "saw _that_ solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look, and in his\n",

      "alone, which I was very desirous of doing. My object—my wish—my sole\n",
      "wish in desiring it—I hope, I believe it is—is to be a means of giving\n",
      "comfort;—no, I must not say comfort—not present comfort—but conviction,\n",
      "lasting conviction to your sister’s mind. My regard for her, for\n",
      "yourself, for your mother—will you allow me to prove it, by relating\n",
      "some circumstances which nothing but a _very_ sincere regard—nothing\n",
      "but an earnest desire of being useful—I think I am justified—though\n",
      "where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am\n",
      "right, is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?” He stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand you,” said Elinor. “You have something to tell me of Mr.\n",

      "this will give you no idea—I must go farther back. You will find me a\n",
      "very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin. A\n",
      "short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it _shall_\n",

      "between us one evening at Barton Park—it was the evening of a dance—in\n",
      "which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some\n",
      "measure, your sister Marianne.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed,” answered Elinor, “I have _not_ forgotten it.” He looked\n",
      "pleased by this remembrance, and added,\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender\n",
      "recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well\n",
      "in mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of\n",
      "fancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan\n",
      "from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our ages\n",
      "were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows\n",
      "and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and\n",
      "my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from\n",
      "my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable\n",
      "of having ever felt. Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the\n",
      "attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a\n",
      "different cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me\n",
      "for ever. She was married—married against her inclination to my\n",
      "brother. Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.\n",
      "And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who\n",
      "was at once her uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he\n",
      "did not even love her. I had hoped that her regard for me would support\n",
      "her under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the\n",
      "misery of her situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame\n",
      "all her resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing—but how\n",
      "blindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We\n",
      "were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The\n",
      "treachery, or the folly, of my cousin’s maid betrayed us. I was\n",
      "banished to the house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no\n",
      "liberty, no society, no amusement, till my father’s point was gained. I\n",
      "had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe\n",
      "one—but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few\n",
      "months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now\n",
      "to lament it. This however was not the case. My brother had no regard\n",
      "for her; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been, and from\n",
      "the first he treated her unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind\n",
      "so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon’s, was but too\n",
      "natural. She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her\n",
      "situation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those\n",
      "regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that,\n",
      "with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to\n",
      "advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after\n",
      "their marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she\n",
      "should fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps—but I meant to promote\n",
      "the happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that\n",
      "purpose had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had\n",
      "given me,” he continued, in a voice of great agitation, “was of\n",
      "trifling weight—was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two\n",
      "years afterwards, of her divorce. It was _that_ which threw this\n",
      "gloom,—even now the recollection of what I suffered—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about\n",
      "the room. Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by his\n",
      "distress, could not speak. He saw her concern, and coming to her, took\n",
      "her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect. A few\n",
      "minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned\n",
      "to England. My first care, when I _did_ arrive, was of course to seek\n",
      "for her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy. I could\n",
      "not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to\n",
      "fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of\n",
      "sin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor\n",
      "sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my\n",
      "brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months\n",
      "before to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,\n",
      "that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to\n",
      "dispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I\n",
      "had been six months in England, I _did_ find her. Regard for a former\n",
      "servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to\n",
      "visit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and\n",
      "there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my\n",
      "unfortunate sister. So altered—so faded—worn down by acute suffering of\n",
      "every kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure\n",
      "before me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,\n",
      "on whom I had once doted. What I endured in so beholding her—but I have\n",
      "no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it—I have\n",
      "pained you too much already. That she was, to all appearance, in the\n",
      "last stage of a consumption, was—yes, in such a situation it was my\n",
      "greatest comfort. Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time for\n",
      "a better preparation for death; and that was given. I saw her placed in\n",
      "comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited her every\n",
      "day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her last\n",
      "moments.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in\n",
      "an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,” said he, “by the resemblance\n",
      "I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation. Their fates,\n",
      "their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet\n",
      "disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier\n",
      "marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other\n",
      "be. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been distressing you\n",
      "for nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood—a subject such as this—untouched for\n",
      "fourteen years—it is dangerous to handle it at all! I _will_ be more\n",
      "collected—more concise. She left to my care her only child, a little\n",
      "girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then about\n",
      "three years old. She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.\n",
      "It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I have\n",
      "discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her education\n",
      "myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I had no\n",
      "family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school. I\n",
      "saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my brother,\n",
      "(which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the\n",
      "possession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford. I\n",
      "called her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in\n",
      "general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her. It is now\n",
      "three years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I\n",
      "removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very\n",
      "respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four\n",
      "or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I\n",
      "had every reason to be pleased with her situation. But last February,\n",
      "almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared. I had allowed her,\n",
      "(imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire, to go\n",
      "to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her father\n",
      "there for his health. I knew him to be a very good sort of man, and I\n",
      "thought well of his daughter—better than she deserved, for, with a most\n",
      "obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no\n",
      "clue, though she certainly knew all. He, her father, a well-meaning,\n",
      "but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no\n",
      "information; for he had been generally confined to the house, while the\n",
      "girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they\n",
      "chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced\n",
      "himself, of his daughter’s being entirely unconcerned in the business.\n",
      "In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest,\n",
      "for eight long months, was left to conjecture. What I thought, what I\n",
      "feared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good heavens!” cried Elinor, “could it be—could Willoughby!”—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first news that reached me of her,” he continued, “came in a\n",
      "letter from herself, last October. It was forwarded to me from\n",
      "Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party\n",
      "to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,\n",
      "which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,\n",
      "and which I believe gave offence to some. Little did Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "imagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in\n",
      "breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom\n",
      "he had made poor and miserable; but _had_ he known it, what would it\n",
      "have availed? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles\n",
      "of your sister? No, he had already done that, which no man who _can_\n",
      "feel for another would do. He had left the girl whose youth and\n",
      "innocence he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with\n",
      "no creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He\n",
      "had left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor\n",
      "relieved her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is beyond every thing!” exclaimed Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse than\n",
      "both. Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what I\n",
      "must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and on\n",
      "being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt\n",
      "for all your sakes. When I came to you last week and found you alone, I\n",
      "came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when it\n",
      "_was_ known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but now\n",
      "you will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so deceived; to see\n",
      "your sister—but what could I do? I had no hope of interfering with\n",
      "success; and sometimes I thought your sister’s influence might yet\n",
      "reclaim him. But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what\n",
      "were his designs on her. Whatever they may have been, however, she may\n",
      "now, and hereafter doubtless _will_ turn with gratitude towards her own\n",
      "condition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she\n",
      "considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and\n",
      "pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as\n",
      "strong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which\n",
      "must attend her through life. Surely this comparison must have its use\n",
      "with her. She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing. They proceed\n",
      "from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. On the contrary, every\n",
      "friend must be made still more her friend by them. Concern for her\n",
      "unhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen\n",
      "every attachment. Use your own discretion, however, in communicating to\n",
      "her what I have told you. You must know best what will be its effect;\n",
      "but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed it might be of\n",
      "service, might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered myself to\n",
      "trouble you with this account of my family afflictions, with a recital\n",
      "which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of\n",
      "others.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor’s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;\n",
      "attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to\n",
      "Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been more pained,” said she, “by her endeavors to acquit him\n",
      "than by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most\n",
      "perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do. Now, though at first she\n",
      "will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier. Have you,” she\n",
      "continued, after a short silence, “ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you\n",
      "left him at Barton?”\n",

      "“Yes,” he replied gravely, “once I have. One meeting was unavoidable.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“What? have you met him to—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could meet him no other way. Eliza had confessed to me, though most\n",

      "effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,\n",
      "in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of\n",
      "compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violently\n",
      "irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched. Her mind did\n",
      "become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection. She felt the\n",
      "loss of Willoughby’s character yet more heavily than she had felt the\n",
      "loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the\n",
      "misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might\n",
      "_once_ have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,\n",
      "that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to\n",
      "Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to\n",
      "her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most\n",
      "frequent confession of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and\n",
      "answering Elinor’s letter would be only to give a repetition of what\n",
      "her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly\n",
      "less painful than Marianne’s, and an indignation even greater than\n",
      "Elinor’s. Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other, arrived\n",
      "to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her anxious\n",
      "solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with fortitude\n",
      "under this misfortune. Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne’s\n",
      "affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying and\n",
      "humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which _she_ could wish\n",
      "her not to indulge!\n",
      "\n",
      "Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had\n",
      "determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at\n",
      "that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be\n",
      "bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by\n",
      "constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen\n",
      "him there. She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all means\n",
      "not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which,\n",
      "though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at\n",
      "least five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of objects, and of\n",
      "company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable\n",
      "there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some\n",
      "interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the\n",
      "ideas of both might now be spurned by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her\n",
      "to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his\n",
      "acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her\n",
      "friends. Design could never bring them in each other’s way: negligence\n",
      "could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in\n",
      "its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of\n",
      "Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at\n",
      "Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at first\n",
      "as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where\n",
      "they were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his\n",
      "wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged\n",
      "it right that they should sometimes see their brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother’s opinion, and she\n",
      "submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved\n",
      "perfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt\n",
      "it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by\n",
      "requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only\n",
      "possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her\n",
      "mother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent\n",
      "her ever knowing a moment’s rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought evil\n",
      "to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the other\n",
      "hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward\n",
      "entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay\n",
      "would therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be better\n",
      "for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby’s\n",
      "name mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing\n",
      "it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor\n",
      "Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.\n",
      "Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards\n",
      "herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day\n",
      "after day to the indignation of them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John, could not have thought it possible. “A man of whom he had\n",
      "always had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He\n",
      "did not believe there was a bolder rider in England! It was an\n",
      "unaccountable business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart.\n",
      "He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for\n",
      "all the world! No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,\n",
      "and they were kept watching for two hours together. Such a scoundrel of\n",
      "a fellow! such a deceitful dog! It was only the last time they met that\n",
      "he had offered him one of Folly’s puppies! and this was the end of it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry. “She was determined to drop\n",
      "his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she had\n",
      "never been acquainted with him at all. She wished with all her heart\n",
      "Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify, for it\n",
      "was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much that she\n",

      "everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of Mrs. Palmer’s sympathy was shown in procuring all the\n",
      "particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicating\n",

      "carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby’s portrait was\n",
      "drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey’s clothes might be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a\n",
      "happy relief to Elinor’s spirits, oppressed as they often were by the\n",
      "clamorous kindness of the others. It was a great comfort to her to be\n",
      "sure of exciting no interest in _one_ person at least among their\n",
      "circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was _one_ who\n",
      "would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any\n",
      "anxiety for her sister’s health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the\n",
      "moment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried down\n",

      "comfort than good-nature.\n",

      "without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without\n",
      "recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the\n",
      "dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was\n",
      "wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the\n",
      "interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though rather\n",
      "against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once\n",

      "discussion of her sister’s disappointment, by the friendly zeal with\n",
      "which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with\n",
      "confidence. His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing\n",
      "past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye\n",
      "with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her\n",
      "voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or\n",
      "could oblige herself to speak to him. _These_ assured him that his\n",
      "exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and\n",
      "_these_ gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the\n",
      "Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail\n",
      "on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it for\n",
      "him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of\n",
      "Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of\n",
      "a week that it would not be a match at all. The good understanding\n",

      "herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she was\n",

      "London yet awhile; though you _told_ me, you know, at Barton, that you\n",
      "should not stay above a _month_. But I thought, at the time, that you\n",
      "would most likely change your mind when it came to the point. It would\n",
      "have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and\n",
      "sister came. And now to be sure you will be in no _hurry_ to be gone. I\n",

      "\n",
      "“Not in the stage, I assure you,” replied Miss Steele, with quick\n",
      "exultation; “we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to\n",

      "\n",
      "After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister’s entreaties, and\n",
      "consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an\n",
      "hour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and\n",
      "would do no more than accompany them to Gray’s in Sackville Street,\n",
      "where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few\n",
      "old-fashioned jewels of her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was\n",
      "a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and as\n",
      "she had no business at Gray’s, it was resolved, that while her young\n",

      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before\n",
      "them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to\n",
      "their orders; and they were obliged to wait. All that could be done\n",
      "was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the\n",
      "quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is\n",
      "probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to\n",
      "a quicker despatch. But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy of\n",
      "his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness. He was giving orders for\n",
      "a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and ornaments\n",
      "were determined, all of which, after examining and debating for a\n",
      "quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were finally\n",
      "arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure to bestow any\n",
      "other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised in three or\n",
      "four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to imprint on\n",
      "Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong, natural,\n",
      "sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and\n",
      "resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on\n",
      "the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of\n",
      "the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining\n",
      "unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts\n",
      "within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her, in\n",
      "Mr. Gray’s shop, as in her own bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the affair was decided. The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,\n",

      "day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of\n",
      "the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care, and\n",
      "bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as\n",
      "seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a\n",
      "happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.\n",

      "Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point\n",
      "of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side.\n",

      "to be her brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very\n",
      "creditable appearance in Mr. Gray’s shop. John Dashwood was really far\n",
      "from being sorry to see his sisters again; it rather gave them\n",

      "Harry was vastly pleased. _This_ morning I had fully intended to call\n",
      "on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always\n",
      "so much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to bespeak Fanny\n",
      "a seal. But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in\n",
      "Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. I\n",
      "understand she is a woman of very good fortune. And the Middletons too,\n",
      "you must introduce me to _them_. As my mother-in-law’s relations, I\n",
      "shall be happy to show them every respect. They are excellent\n",
      "neighbours to you in the country, I understand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excellent indeed. Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness\n",

      "\n",

      "upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she\n",
      "should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her\n",
      "sisters to see her. His manners to _them_, though calm, were perfectly\n",
      "kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel\n",
      "Brandon’s coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiosity\n",
      "which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to be\n",
      "equally civil to _him_.\n",
      "\n",
      "After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him\n",
      "to Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.\n",
      "The weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented. As soon as\n",
      "they were out of the house, his enquiries began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is Colonel Brandon? Is he a man of fortune?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad of it. He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,\n",
      "Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable\n",
      "establishment in life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me, brother! what do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He likes you. I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it. What is\n",
      "the amount of his fortune?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe about two thousand a year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two thousand a-year;” and then working himself up to a pitch of\n",
      "enthusiastic generosity, he added, “Elinor, I wish with all my heart it\n",
      "were _twice_ as much, for your sake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed I believe you,” replied Elinor; “but I am very sure that\n",
      "Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying _me_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. A very little\n",
      "trouble on your side secures him. Perhaps just at present he may be\n",
      "undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his\n",
      "friends may all advise him against it. But some of those little\n",
      "attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix\n",
      "him, in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you should not\n",
      "try for him. It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your\n",
      "side—in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite\n",
      "out of the question, the objections are insurmountable—you have too\n",
      "much sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man; and no\n",
      "civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and\n",
      "your family. It is a match that must give universal satisfaction. In\n",
      "short, it is a kind of thing that”—lowering his voice to an important\n",
      "whisper—“will be exceedingly welcome to _all parties_.” Recollecting\n",
      "himself, however, he added, “That is, I mean to say—your friends are\n",
      "all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly, for she\n",
      "has your interest very much at heart, I assure you. And her mother too,\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am sure it would give her\n",
      "great pleasure; she said as much the other day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be something remarkable, now,” he continued, “something\n",
      "droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the\n",
      "same time. And yet it is not very unlikely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,” said Elinor, with resolution, “going to be\n",
      "married?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation. He\n",
      "has a most excellent mother. Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality,\n",
      "will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if the match\n",
      "takes place. The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter of the\n",
      "late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds. A very desirable\n",
      "connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in\n",
      "time. A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to\n",
      "make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. To give you\n",
      "another instance of her liberality:—The other day, as soon as we came\n",
      "to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now,\n",
      "she put bank-notes into Fanny’s hands to the amount of two hundred\n",
      "pounds. And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great\n",
      "expense while we are here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable;\n",
      "but your income is a large one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose. I do not mean to\n",
      "complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope will\n",
      "in time be better. The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on, is\n",
      "a most serious drain. And then I have made a little purchase within\n",
      "this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where\n",
      "old Gibson used to live. The land was so very desirable for me in every\n",
      "respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it my\n",
      "duty to buy it. I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it\n",
      "fall into any other hands. A man must pay for his convenience; and it\n",
      "_has_ cost me a vast deal of money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, I hope not that. I might have sold it again, the next day, for\n",
      "more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have\n",
      "been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,\n",
      "that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker’s\n",
      "hands, I must have sold out to very great loss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could only smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to\n",
      "Norland. Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the\n",
      "Stanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)\n",
      "to your mother. Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he had an\n",
      "undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose, but, in\n",
      "consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of\n",
      "linen, china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away. You may\n",
      "guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being\n",
      "rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars’s kindness is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” said Elinor; “and assisted by her liberality, I hope you\n",
      "may yet live to be in easy circumstances.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Another year or two may do much towards it,” he gravely replied; “but\n",
      "however there is still a great deal to be done. There is not a stone\n",
      "laid of Fanny’s green-house, and nothing but the plan of the\n",
      "flower-garden marked out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is the green-house to be?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon the knoll behind the house. The old walnut trees are all come\n",
      "down to make room for it. It will be a very fine object from many parts\n",
      "of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before it, and\n",
      "be exceedingly pretty. We have cleared away all the old thorns that\n",
      "grew in patches over the brow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very\n",
      "thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away the\n",
      "necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in his\n",
      "next visit at Gray’s, his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he\n",
      "began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She seems a most valuable woman indeed. Her house, her style of\n",
      "living, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an acquaintance\n",
      "that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may\n",
      "prove materially advantageous. Her inviting you to town is certainly a\n",
      "vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a\n",
      "regard for you, that in all probability when she dies you will not be\n",
      "forgotten. She must have a great deal to leave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her\n",
      "jointure, which will descend to her children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income. Few\n",
      "people of common prudence will do _that_ and whatever she saves, she\n",
      "will be able to dispose of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her\n",
      "daughters, than to us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I\n",
      "cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther. Whereas,\n",
      "in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and treating you in\n",
      "this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her future\n",
      "consideration, which a conscientious woman would not disregard. Nothing\n",
      "can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can hardly do all this,\n",
      "without being aware of the expectation it raises.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she raises none in those most concerned. Indeed, brother, your\n",
      "anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, to be sure,” said he, seeming to recollect himself, “people have\n",
      "little, have very little in their power. But, my dear Elinor, what is\n",
      "the matter with Marianne?—she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,\n",
      "and is grown quite thin. Is she ill?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several\n",
      "weeks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of an illness\n",
      "destroys the bloom for ever! Hers has been a very short one! She was as\n",
      "handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract\n",
      "the man. There was something in her style of beauty, to please them\n",
      "particularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner\n",
      "and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of _you_,\n",
      "but so it happened to strike her. She will be mistaken, however. I\n",
      "question whether Marianne _now_, will marry a man worth more than five\n",
      "or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if\n",
      "_you_ do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very little of Dorsetshire;\n",
      "but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;\n",
      "and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the\n",
      "earliest and best pleased of your visitors.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no\n",
      "likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation\n",
      "of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really\n",
      "resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the\n",
      "marriage by every possible attention. He had just compunction enough\n",
      "for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly\n",
      "anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from\n",
      "Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means\n",
      "of atoning for his own neglect.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John\n",
      "came in before their visit ended. Abundance of civilities passed on all\n",
      "sides. Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did\n",
      "not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very\n",
      "good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his\n",
      "appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood\n",
      "went away delighted with both.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny,” said he, as he\n",
      "walked back with his sister. “Lady Middleton is really a most elegant\n",
      "woman! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know. And Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant\n",
      "as her daughter. Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting\n",
      "_her_, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and very\n",
      "naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man\n",
      "who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were\n",
      "both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughters were\n",
      "such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with. But now I can\n",
      "carry her a most satisfactory account of both.”\n",

      "CHAPTER XXXIV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband’s judgment,\n",
      "that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her\n",
      "daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,\n",
      "even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthy\n",
      "her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the most\n",
      "charming women in the world!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood. There was a kind\n",
      "of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted\n",
      "them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of\n",
      "demeanor, and a general want of understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the\n",
      "good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "and to _her_ she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking\n",
      "woman of uncordial address, who met her husband’s sisters without any\n",
      "affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of\n",
      "the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least\n",
      "seven minutes and a half in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not chuse to ask,\n",
      "whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny\n",
      "voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that\n",
      "his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband’s\n",
      "expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed\n",
      "them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be\n",
      "too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion. The\n",
      "intelligence however, which _she_ would not give, soon flowed from\n",
      "another quarter. Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor’s compassion on\n",
      "being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood. He dared not come to Bartlett’s Buildings for fear of\n",
      "detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be\n",
      "told, they could do nothing at present but write.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short\n",
      "time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street. Twice was his card found on\n",
      "the table, when they returned from their morning’s engagements. Elinor\n",
      "was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had\n",
      "missed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that,\n",
      "though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to\n",
      "give them—a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited\n",
      "them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house\n",
      "for three months. Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited\n",
      "likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who,\n",
      "always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager\n",
      "civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure. They were to\n",
      "meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to\n",
      "be of the party. The expectation of seeing _her_, however, was enough\n",
      "to make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet\n",
      "Edward’s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to\n",
      "attend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect\n",
      "indifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in\n",
      "company with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was\n",
      "as lively as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon\n",
      "afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing\n",
      "that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable\n",
      "had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainly\n",
      "not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as ready as\n",
      "Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it\n",
      "happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as\n",
      "the Dashwoods’ invitation was known, that their visit should begin a\n",
      "few days before the party took place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the\n",
      "gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might not\n",
      "have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her table; but\n",
      "as Lady Middleton’s guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long\n",
      "wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of\n",
      "their characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity\n",
      "of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life,\n",
      "than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood’s card.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Elinor its effect was very different. She began immediately to\n",
      "determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his\n",
      "mother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the\n",
      "first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!—she hardly\n",
      "knew how she could bear it!\n",
      "\n",
      "These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and\n",
      "certainly not at all on truth. They were relieved however, not by her\n",
      "own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to\n",
      "be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward\n",
      "certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to\n",
      "be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept\n",
      "away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal\n",
      "when they were together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies\n",
      "to this formidable mother-in-law.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!” said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs\n",
      "together—for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "that they all followed the servant at the same time:—“there is nobody\n",
      "here but you, that can feel for me. I declare I can hardly stand. Good\n",
      "gracious! In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness\n",
      "depends on—that is to be my mother!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the\n",
      "possibility of its being Miss Morton’s mother, rather than her own,\n",
      "whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured\n",
      "her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her—to the utter\n",
      "amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at\n",
      "least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in\n",
      "her figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect. Her\n",
      "complexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and\n",
      "naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had\n",
      "rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it\n",
      "the strong characters of pride and ill nature. She was not a woman of\n",
      "many words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to the\n",
      "number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her, not\n",
      "one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the spirited\n",
      "determination of disliking her at all events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not _now_ be made unhappy by this behaviour. A few months\n",
      "ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars’\n",
      "power to distress her by it now; and the difference of her manners to\n",
      "the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made to humble\n",
      "her more, only amused her. She could not but smile to see the\n",
      "graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person—for\n",
      "Lucy was particularly distinguished—whom of all others, had they known\n",
      "as much as she did, they would have been most anxious to mortify; while\n",
      "she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat\n",
      "pointedly slighted by both. But while she smiled at a graciousness so\n",
      "misapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which\n",
      "it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss\n",
      "Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all\n",
      "four.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss\n",
      "Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every thing\n",
      "bespoke the Mistress’s inclination for show, and the Master’s ability\n",
      "to support it. In spite of the improvements and additions which were\n",
      "making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner having once\n",
      "been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a\n",
      "loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to\n",
      "infer from it;—no poverty of any kind, except of conversation,\n",
      "appeared—but there, the deficiency was considerable. John Dashwood had\n",
      "not much to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his wife had\n",
      "still less. But there was no peculiar disgrace in this; for it was very\n",
      "much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured\n",
      "under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable—Want\n",
      "of sense, either natural or improved—want of elegance—want of\n",
      "spirits—or want of temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this poverty\n",
      "was particularly evident, for the gentlemen _had_ supplied the\n",
      "discourse with some variety—the variety of politics, inclosing land,\n",
      "and breaking horses—but then it was all over; and one subject only\n",
      "engaged the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative\n",
      "heights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton’s second son William, who\n",
      "were nearly of the same age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had both the children been there, the affair might have been determined\n",
      "too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present, it\n",
      "was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body had a right\n",
      "to be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and over\n",
      "again as often as they liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parties stood thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the\n",
      "tallest, politely decided in favour of the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity,\n",
      "were equally earnest in support of their own descendant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,\n",
      "thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not\n",
      "conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world\n",
      "between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as\n",
      "fast as she could, in favour of each.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on William’s side, by which\n",
      "she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the\n",
      "necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when\n",
      "called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had no\n",
      "opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair\n",
      "of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and\n",
      "brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,\n",
      "catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen\n",
      "into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for\n",
      "his admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These are done by my eldest sister,” said he; “and you, as a man of\n",
      "taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them. I do not know whether\n",
      "you have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she\n",
      "is in general reckoned to draw extremely well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,\n",
      "warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by\n",
      "Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course\n",
      "excited, they were handed round for general inspection. Mrs. Ferrars,\n",
      "not aware of their being Elinor’s work, particularly requested to look\n",
      "at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady\n",
      "Middletons’s approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother,\n",
      "considerately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by\n",
      "Miss Dashwood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hum”—said Mrs. Ferrars—“very pretty,”—and without regarding them at\n",
      "all, returned them to her daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude\n",
      "enough,—for, colouring a little, she immediately said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are very pretty, ma’am—an’t they?” But then again, the dread of\n",
      "having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her,\n",
      "for she presently added,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton’s style of\n",
      "painting, Ma’am?—_She does_ paint most delightfully!—How beautifully\n",
      "her last landscape is done!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beautifully indeed! But _she_ does every thing well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne could not bear this.—She was already greatly displeased with\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor’s\n",
      "expense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by\n",
      "it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth,\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is admiration of a very particular kind!—what is Miss Morton to\n",
      "us?—who knows, or who cares, for her?—it is Elinor of whom _we_ think\n",
      "and speak.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law’s hands,\n",
      "to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more\n",
      "stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, “Miss\n",
      "Morton is Lord Morton’s daughter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at his\n",
      "sister’s audacity. Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne’s warmth than\n",
      "she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon’s eyes, as they\n",
      "were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable\n",
      "in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister\n",
      "slighted in the smallest point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne’s feelings did not stop here. The cold insolence of Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars’s general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell\n",
      "such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart\n",
      "taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of\n",
      "affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister’s\n",
      "chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers,\n",
      "said in a low, but eager, voice,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear, dear Elinor, don’t mind them. Don’t let them make _you_\n",
      "unhappy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her\n",
      "face on Elinor’s shoulder, she burst into tears. Every body’s attention\n",
      "was called, and almost every body was concerned.—Colonel Brandon rose\n",
      "up and went to them without knowing what he did.—Mrs. Jennings, with a\n",
      "very intelligent “Ah! poor dear,” immediately gave her her salts; and\n",
      "Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous\n",
      "distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy\n",
      "Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole\n",
      "shocking affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end\n",
      "to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retained\n",
      "the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor Marianne!” said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,\n",
      "as soon as he could secure his attention: “She has not such good health\n",
      "as her sister,—she is very nervous,—she has not Elinor’s\n",
      "constitution;—and one must allow that there is something very trying to\n",
      "a young woman who _has been_ a beauty in the loss of her personal\n",
      "attractions. You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne _was_\n",
      "remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor. Now\n",
      "you see it is all gone.”\n",

      "CHAPTER XXXV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor’s curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied. She had found in\n",
      "her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between\n",
      "the families undesirable. She had seen enough of her pride, her\n",
      "meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend\n",
      "all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and\n",
      "retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise\n",
      "free; and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her _own_ sake,\n",
      "that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other\n",
      "of Mrs. Ferrars’s creation, preserved her from all dependence upon her\n",
      "caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion. Or at least, if she\n",
      "did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward’s being fettered to\n",
      "Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she _ought_ to\n",
      "have rejoiced.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wondered that Lucy’s spirits could be so very much elevated by the\n",
      "civility of Mrs. Ferrars;—that her interest and her vanity should so\n",
      "very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her\n",
      "because she was _not Elinor_, appear a compliment to herself—or to\n",
      "allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,\n",
      "because her real situation was unknown. But that it was so, had not\n",
      "only been declared by Lucy’s eyes at the time, but was declared over\n",
      "again the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady\n",
      "Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing\n",
      "Elinor alone, to tell her how happy she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon\n",
      "after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear friend,” cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, “I\n",
      "come to talk to you of my happiness. Could anything be so flattering as\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars’s way of treating me yesterday? So exceeding affable as\n",
      "she was! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her; but the\n",
      "very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her\n",
      "behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to\n",
      "me. Now was not it so? You saw it all; and was not you quite struck\n",
      "with it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She was certainly very civil to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Civil!—Did you see nothing but only civility?—I saw a vast deal more.\n",
      "Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!—No pride, no\n",
      "hauteur, and your sister just the same—all sweetness and affability!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to\n",
      "own that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go\n",
      "on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,” said she, “nothing\n",
      "could be more flattering than their treatment of you;—but as that was\n",
      "not the case—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I guessed you would say so,”—replied Lucy quickly—“but there was no\n",
      "reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did\n",
      "not, and her liking me is every thing. You shan’t talk me out of my\n",
      "satisfaction. I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no\n",
      "difficulties at all, to what I used to think. Mrs. Ferrars is a\n",
      "charming woman, and so is your sister. They are both delightful women,\n",
      "indeed!—I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood was!”\n",
      "\n",
      "To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?—you seem low—you don’t speak;—sure you\n",
      "an’t well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never was in better health.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it. I\n",
      "should be sorry to have _you_ ill; you, that have been the greatest\n",
      "comfort to me in the world!—Heaven knows what I should have done\n",
      "without your friendship.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.\n",
      "But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to\n",
      "Edward’s love, it is the greatest comfort I have. Poor Edward! But now\n",
      "there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty\n",
      "often, for Lady Middleton’s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall\n",
      "be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his\n",
      "time with his sister—besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will\n",
      "visit now;—and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say\n",
      "more than once, they should always be glad to see me. They are such\n",
      "charming women!—I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of\n",
      "her, you cannot speak too high.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she\n",
      "_should_ tell her sister. Lucy continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took\n",
      "a dislike to me. If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for\n",
      "instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of\n",
      "me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way—you know what I mean—if I\n",
      "had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gave it\n",
      "all up in despair. I could not have stood it. For where she _does_\n",
      "dislike, I know it is most violent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by\n",
      "the door’s being thrown open, the servant’s announcing Mr. Ferrars, and\n",
      "Edward’s immediately walking in.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each showed that\n",
      "it was so. They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to\n",
      "have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to\n",
      "advance farther into it. The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest\n",
      "form, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had fallen\n",
      "on them.—They were not only all three together, but were together\n",
      "without the relief of any other person. The ladies recovered themselves\n",
      "first. It was not Lucy’s business to put herself forward, and the\n",
      "appearance of secrecy must still be kept up. She could therefore only\n",
      "_look_ her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him, said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and her\n",
      "own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment’s\n",
      "recollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost\n",
      "easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still\n",
      "improved them. She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the\n",
      "consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from\n",
      "saying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much\n",
      "regretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.\n",
      "She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as\n",
      "a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes of\n",
      "Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage enough\n",
      "to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in\n",
      "a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex might\n",
      "make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy’s, nor\n",
      "could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no\n",
      "contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;\n",
      "and almost every thing that _was_ said, proceeded from Elinor, who was\n",
      "obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother’s health,\n",
      "their coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,\n",
      "but never did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself\n",
      "so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching\n",
      "Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it, and\n",
      "_that_ in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several minutes\n",
      "on the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she\n",
      "went to her sister. When that was once done, however, it was time for\n",
      "the raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne’s joy hurried her into\n",
      "the drawing-room immediately. Her pleasure in seeing him was like every\n",
      "other of her feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken. She met\n",
      "him with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the\n",
      "affection of a sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Edward!” she cried, “this is a moment of great happiness!—This\n",
      "would almost make amends for every thing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such\n",
      "witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt. Again they all sat\n",
      "down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was\n",
      "looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and\n",
      "sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other\n",
      "should be checked by Lucy’s unwelcome presence. Edward was the first to\n",
      "speak, and it was to notice Marianne’s altered looks, and express his\n",
      "fear of her not finding London agree with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t think of me!” she replied with spirited earnestness, though\n",
      "her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, “don’t think of _my_\n",
      "health. Elinor is well, you see. That must be enough for us both.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor\n",
      "to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no\n",
      "very benignant expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you like London?” said Edward, willing to say any thing that might\n",
      "introduce another subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all. I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none. The\n",
      "sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and thank\n",
      "Heaven! you are what you always were!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused—no one spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think, Elinor,” she presently added, “we must employ Edward to take\n",
      "care of us in our return to Barton. In a week or two, I suppose, we\n",
      "shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to\n",
      "accept the charge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even\n",
      "himself. But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace it\n",
      "to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, and\n",
      "soon talked of something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! So dull, so\n",
      "wretchedly dull!—But I have much to say to you on that head, which\n",
      "cannot be said now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her\n",
      "finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her\n",
      "being particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in\n",
      "private.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why were you not there, Edward?—Why did you not come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was engaged elsewhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Engaged! But what was that, when such friends were to be met?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps, Miss Marianne,” cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on\n",
      "her, “you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no\n",
      "mind to keep them, little as well as great.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the\n",
      "sting; for she calmly replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that\n",
      "conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. And I really believe he\n",
      "_has_ the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous in\n",
      "performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make\n",
      "against his interest or pleasure. He is the most fearful of giving\n",
      "pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish,\n",
      "of any body I ever saw. Edward, it is so, and I will say it. What! are\n",
      "you never to hear yourself praised!—Then you must be no friend of mine;\n",
      "for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to my open\n",
      "commendation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened\n",
      "to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her\n",

      "\n",
      "“Going so soon!” said Marianne; “my dear Edward, this must not be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy\n",
      "could not stay much longer. But even this encouragement failed, for he\n",
      "would go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted\n",
      "two hours, soon afterwards went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What can bring her here so often?” said Marianne, on her leaving them.\n",
      "“Could not she see that we wanted her gone!—how teazing to Edward!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why so?—we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known\n",
      "to him of any. It is but natural that he should like to see her as well\n",
      "as ourselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, “You know, Elinor, that this\n",
      "is a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope to have your\n",
      "assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to\n",
      "recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it. I cannot\n",
      "descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really wanted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more,\n",
      "for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give\n",
      "no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the\n",
      "consequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was\n",
      "obliged to submit to it. All that she could hope, was that Edward would\n",
      "not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne’s\n",

      "Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the\n",
      "world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a\n",
      "son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least\n",
      "to all those intimate connections who knew it before.\n",
      "\n",
      "This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings’s happiness, produced a\n",
      "temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a\n",
      "like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished to\n",
      "be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning\n",
      "as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the\n",
      "evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the\n",
      "Middletons, spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their\n",
      "own comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the\n",
      "morning, in Mrs. Jennings’s house; but it was not a thing to be urged\n",
      "against the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over\n",
      "to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in\n",
      "fact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and\n",
      "by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on\n",
      "_their_ ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to\n",
      "monopolize. Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton’s\n",
      "behaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.\n",
      "Because they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not\n",
      "believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she\n",
      "fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to\n",
      "be satirical; but _that_ did not signify. It was censure in common use,\n",
      "and easily given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy. It checked the\n",
      "idleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton was\n",
      "ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was\n",
      "proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would\n",
      "despise her for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the\n",
      "three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her to\n",
      "it entirely. Would either of them only have given her a full and minute\n",
      "account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she\n",
      "would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best\n",
      "place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned. But\n",
      "this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out\n",
      "expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt\n",
      "a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was\n",
      "produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in\n",
      "the latter. An effort even yet lighter might have made her their\n",
      "friend. Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor! But so\n",
      "little were they, any more than the others, inclined to oblige her,\n",
      "that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole day without\n",
      "hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she was kind\n",
      "enough to bestow on herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally\n",
      "unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing\n",
      "for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young\n",
      "friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old\n",
      "woman so long. She joined them sometimes at Sir John’s, sometimes at\n",
      "her own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent\n",
      "spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte’s well\n",
      "doing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail\n",
      "of her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.\n",
      "One thing _did_ disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint.\n",
      "Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex,\n",
      "of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly perceive, at\n",
      "different times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and\n",
      "every one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing his\n",
      "father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like\n",
      "every other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought to\n",
      "acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the\n",
      "world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time\n",
      "befell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so happened that while her two sisters\n",
      "with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another\n",
      "of her acquaintance had dropt in—a circumstance in itself not\n",
      "apparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginations of\n",
      "other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our\n",
      "conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one’s happiness\n",
      "must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present\n",
      "instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun\n",
      "truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss\n",
      "Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood’s sisters, she\n",
      "immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this\n",
      "misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of\n",
      "invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small\n",
      "musical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that Mrs.\n",
      "John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great\n",
      "inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what\n",
      "was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing\n",
      "to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might not\n",
      "expect to go out with her a second time? The power of disappointing\n",
      "them, it was true, must always be hers. But that was not enough; for\n",
      "when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be\n",
      "wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of\n",
      "going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to\n",
      "her, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and mechanically\n",
      "for every evening’s engagement, though without expecting the smallest\n",
      "amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till the last\n",
      "moment, where it was to take her.\n",
      "\n",
      "To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as\n",
      "not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her\n",
      "toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of\n",
      "their being together, when it was finished. Nothing escaped _her_\n",
      "minute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and\n",
      "asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every part\n",
      "of Marianne’s dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns\n",
      "altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not\n",
      "without hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her washing\n",
      "cost per week, and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.\n",
      "The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally\n",
      "concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was\n",
      "considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after\n",
      "undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the\n",
      "colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost\n",
      "sure of being told that upon “her word she looked vastly smart, and she\n",
      "dared to say she would make a great many conquests.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present\n",
      "occasion, to her brother’s carriage; which they were ready to enter\n",
      "five minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very\n",
      "agreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house of\n",
      "her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part\n",
      "that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The events of this evening were not very remarkable. The party, like\n",
      "other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real\n",
      "taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;\n",
      "and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,\n",
      "and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in\n",
      "England.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made no\n",
      "scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it\n",
      "suited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and\n",
      "violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the\n",
      "room. In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of\n",
      "young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases\n",
      "at Gray’s. She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself, and\n",
      "speaking familiarly to her brother; and had just determined to find out\n",
      "his name from the latter, when they both came towards her, and Mr.\n",
      "Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.\n",
      "\n",
      "He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow\n",
      "which assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was\n",
      "exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy. Happy\n",
      "had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his\n",
      "own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations! For then his\n",
      "brother’s bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the\n",
      "ill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun. But while she\n",
      "wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that\n",
      "the emptiness and conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with\n",
      "the modesty and worth of the other. Why they _were_ different, Robert\n",
      "explained to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour’s\n",
      "conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme\n",
      "_gaucherie_ which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper\n",
      "society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any\n",
      "natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;\n",
      "while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material\n",
      "superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,\n",
      "was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my soul,” he added, “I believe it is nothing more; and so I often\n",
      "tell my mother, when she is grieving about it. ‘My dear Madam,’ I\n",
      "always say to her, ‘you must make yourself easy. The evil is now\n",
      "irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing. Why would you be\n",
      "persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to place\n",
      "Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his life? If\n",
      "you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself, instead of\n",
      "sending him to Mr. Pratt’s, all this would have been prevented.’ This\n",
      "is the way in which I always consider the matter, and my mother is\n",
      "perfectly convinced of her error.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her\n",
      "general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could not\n",
      "think of Edward’s abode in Mr. Pratt’s family, with any satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You reside in Devonshire, I think,”—was his next observation, “in a\n",
      "cottage near Dawlish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather\n",
      "surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without living\n",
      "near Dawlish. He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their\n",
      "species of house.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For my own part,” said he, “I am excessively fond of a cottage; there\n",
      "is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them. And I protest,\n",
      "if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one\n",
      "myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself\n",
      "down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy. I\n",
      "advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. My friend\n",
      "Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,\n",
      "and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi’s. I was to decide\n",
      "on the best of them. ‘My dear Courtland,’ said I, immediately throwing\n",
      "them all into the fire, ‘do not adopt either of them, but by all means\n",
      "build a cottage.’ And that I fancy, will be the end of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a\n",
      "cottage; but this is all a mistake. I was last month at my friend\n",
      "Elliott’s, near Dartford. Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. ‘But how\n",
      "can it be done?’ said she; ‘my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is to be\n",
      "managed. There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple,\n",
      "and where can the supper be?’ _I_ immediately saw that there could be\n",
      "no difficulty in it, so I said, ‘My dear Lady Elliott, do not be\n",
      "uneasy. The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;\n",
      "card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open\n",
      "for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the\n",
      "saloon.’ Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought. We measured the\n",
      "dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the\n",
      "affair was arranged precisely after my plan. So that, in fact, you see,\n",
      "if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as well\n",
      "enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the\n",
      "compliment of rational opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister,\n",
      "his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a thought\n",
      "struck him during the evening, which he communicated to his wife, for\n",
      "her approbation, when they got home. The consideration of Mrs.\n",
      "Dennison’s mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, had\n",
      "suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,\n",
      "while Mrs. Jennings’s engagements kept her from home. The expense would\n",
      "be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an\n",
      "attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be\n",
      "requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his\n",
      "father. Fanny was startled at the proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not see how it can be done,” said she, “without affronting Lady\n",

      "exceedingly glad to do it. You know I am always ready to pay them any\n",
      "attention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shows. But\n",
      "they are Lady Middleton’s visitors. How can I ask them away from her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her\n",
      "objection. “They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit\n",
      "Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the\n",
      "same number of days to such near relations.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“My love, I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.\n",
      "But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a\n",
      "few days with us. They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I\n",
      "think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very well by\n",
      "Edward. We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but the Miss\n",
      "Steeles may not be in town any more. I am sure you will like them;\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood was convinced. He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss\n",

      "of inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly\n",
      "suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by\n",
      "bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon’s wife, and Marianne as\n",
      "_their_ visitor.\n",

      "her sister’s, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady\n",
      "Middleton could spare them. This was enough to make Lucy really and\n",
      "reasonably happy. Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,\n",
      "herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views! Such an\n",
      "opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all things,\n",
      "the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the most\n",
      "gratifying to her feelings! It was an advantage that could not be too\n",
      "gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the visit to\n",
      "Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits, was\n",
      "instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days’\n",
      "time.\n",

      "When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after\n",

      "on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will\n",
      "towards her arose from something more than merely malice against\n",
      "herself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing\n",
      "that Lucy wished. Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady\n",

      "sure it was very ill—it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.\n",
      "So I looked at it directly, and, ‘Lord! my dear,’ says I, ‘it is\n",
      "nothing in the world, but the red gum;’ and nurse said just the same.\n",
      "But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for;\n",
      "and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he\n",
      "stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child, he said\n",
      "just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and\n",
      "then Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was going away again, it\n",
      "came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of\n",
      "it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. So upon\n",
      "that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know\n",
      "something or other, and at last he said in a whisper, ‘For fear any\n",
      "unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to\n",
      "their sister’s indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I\n",
      "believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will\n",
      "do very well.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! is Fanny ill?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is exactly what I said, my dear. ‘Lord!’ says I, ‘is Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood ill?’ So then it all came out; and the long and the short of\n",
      "the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars,\n",
      "the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it\n",
      "turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.\n",
      "Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my\n",
      "cousin Lucy!—There’s for you, my dear! And not a creature knowing a\n",
      "syllable of the matter, except Nancy! Could you have believed such a\n",
      "thing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another;\n",
      "but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody\n",
      "suspect it! _That_ is strange! I never happened to see them together,\n",
      "or I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this was\n",
      "kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your\n",
      "brother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very\n",
      "morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no\n",
      "conjurer, popt it all out. ‘Lord!’ thinks she to herself, ‘they are all\n",
      "so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;’ and\n",
      "so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her\n",
      "carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come—for she had just been\n",
      "saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to\n",
      "make a match between Edward and some Lord’s daughter or other, I forget\n",
      "who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride.\n",
      "She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as\n",
      "reached your brother’s ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing-room\n",
      "down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the\n",
      "country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for\n",
      "Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on.\n",
      "Poor soul! I pity _her_. And I must say, I think she was used very\n",
      "hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into\n",
      "a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and\n",
      "your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not know what\n",
      "to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in\n",
      "the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon _his_ knees too,\n",
      "to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes.\n",
      "_Then_ she fell into hysterics again, and he was so frightened that he\n",
      "would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this\n",
      "uproar. The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins\n",
      "away, and they were just stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such\n",
      "a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost\n",
      "as bad. I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,\n",
      "with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a\n",
      "taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it! To have his love\n",
      "used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well\n",
      "he may. I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest\n",
      "passion!—and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same. He and I had a great\n",
      "deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is gone back\n",
      "again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is\n",
      "told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the\n",
      "house, for your sister was sure _she_ would be in hysterics too; and so\n",
      "she may, for what I care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no\n",
      "notion of people’s making such a to-do about money and greatness. There\n",
      "is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I\n",
      "am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though\n",
      "Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to\n",
      "make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only\n",
      "allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance\n",
      "with it as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might\n",
      "live in such another cottage as yours—or a little bigger—with two\n",
      "maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for\n",
      "my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly.”\n",

      "Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collect\n",
      "her thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make such\n",
      "observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.\n",
      "Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest\n",
      "in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped might be the\n",
      "case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward; and happy\n",
      "above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able\n",
      "to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her judgment,\n",
      "as she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one\n",
      "concerned in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really\n",
      "was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being\n",
      "possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and\n",
      "Lucy. What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could not be a\n",
      "doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still more anxious to\n",
      "know how Edward would conduct himself. For _him_ she felt much\n",
      "compassion;—for Lucy very little—and it cost her some pains to procure\n",
      "that little;—for the rest of the party none at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the\n",
      "necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion. No time was to be\n",
      "lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth,\n",
      "and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,\n",
      "without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any\n",
      "resentment against Edward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor’s office was a painful one.—She was going to remove what she\n",
      "really believed to be her sister’s chief consolation,—to give such\n",
      "particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good\n",
      "opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,\n",
      "which to _her_ fancy would seem strong, feel all her own disappointment\n",
      "over again. But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to\n",
      "be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to\n",
      "represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the\n",
      "self-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward’s\n",
      "engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.\n",
      "Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given\n",
      "without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor\n",
      "impetuous grief. _That_ belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne\n",
      "listened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be the\n",
      "comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and\n",
      "all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure\n",
      "of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but\n",
      "of imprudence, was readily offered.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither. Edward seemed\n",
      "a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she _had_\n",
      "loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself! As for Lucy\n",
      "Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely\n",
      "incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded\n",
      "at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of\n",
      "Edward for her. She would not even admit it to have been natural; and\n",
      "Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only\n",
      "could convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact\n",
      "of the engagement, and the length of time it had existed.—Marianne’s\n",
      "feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of\n",
      "detail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her\n",
      "distress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment. The first\n",
      "question on her side, which led to farther particulars, was,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have known it these four months. When Lucy first came to Barton Park\n",
      "last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At these words, Marianne’s eyes expressed the astonishment which her\n",
      "lips could not utter. After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four months!—Have you known of this four months?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor confirmed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your\n",
      "heart? And I have reproached you for being happy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four months!” cried Marianne again. “So calm! so cheerful! How have\n",
      "you been supported?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By feeling that I was doing my duty.—My promise to Lucy, obliged me to\n",
      "be secret. I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the\n",
      "truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in them a\n",
      "solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to satisfy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne seemed much struck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother,” added\n",
      "Elinor; “and once or twice I have attempted it;—but without betraying\n",
      "my trust, I never could have convinced you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four months! and yet you loved him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. But I did not love only him; and while the comfort of others was\n",
      "dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt. Now,\n",
      "I can think and speak of it with little emotion. I would not have you\n",
      "suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially\n",
      "myself. I have many things to support me. I am not conscious of having\n",
      "provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own, I have borne\n",
      "it as much as possible without spreading it farther. I acquit Edward of\n",
      "essential misconduct. I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his\n",
      "always doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret, in\n",
      "the end he must become so. Lucy does not want sense, and that is the\n",
      "foundation on which every thing good may be built. And after all,\n",
      "Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and\n",
      "constant attachment, and all that can be said of one’s happiness\n",
      "depending entirely on any particular person, it is not meant—it is not\n",
      "fit—it is not possible that it should be so. Edward will marry Lucy; he\n",
      "will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her\n",
      "sex; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought\n",
      "another superior to _her_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If such is your way of thinking,” said Marianne, “if the loss of what\n",
      "is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your\n",
      "resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be\n",
      "wondered at.—They are brought more within my comprehension.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand you. You do not suppose that I have ever felt much. For\n",
      "four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without\n",
      "being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it\n",
      "would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to\n",
      "you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least. It was told me,—it\n",
      "was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior\n",
      "engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with\n",
      "triumph. This person’s suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by\n",
      "endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply\n",
      "interested; and it has not been only once; I have had her hopes and\n",
      "exultation to listen to again and again. I have known myself to be\n",
      "divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance that\n",
      "could make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him\n",
      "unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.  I have had\n",
      "to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of\n",
      "his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without\n",
      "enjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at a time,\n",
      "when, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness. If you\n",
      "can think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that I\n",
      "have suffered _now_. The composure of mind with which I have brought\n",
      "myself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have\n",
      "been willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful\n",
      "exertion; they did not spring up of themselves; they did not occur to\n",
      "relieve my spirits at first. No, Marianne. _Then_, if I had not been\n",
      "bound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely—not even\n",
      "what I owed to my dearest friends—from openly showing that I was _very_\n",
      "unhappy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was quite subdued.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Elinor,” she cried, “you have made me hate myself for ever.—How\n",
      "barbarous have I been to you!—you, who have been my only comfort, who\n",
      "have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only\n",
      "suffering for me!—Is this my gratitude?—Is this the only return I can\n",
      "make you?—Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying\n",
      "to do it away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The tenderest caresses followed this confession. In such a frame of\n",
      "mind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her\n",
      "whatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged\n",
      "never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of\n",
      "bitterness; to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of\n",
      "dislike to her; and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring\n",
      "them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality. These\n",
      "were great concessions; but where Marianne felt that she had injured,\n",
      "no reparation could be too much for her to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.—She\n",
      "attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an\n",
      "unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard\n",
      "three times to say, “Yes, ma’am.”—She listened to her praise of Lucy\n",
      "with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "talked of Edward’s affection, it cost her only a spasm in her\n",
      "throat.—Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel\n",
      "equal to any thing herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their\n",
      "brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful\n",
      "affair, and bring them news of his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have heard, I suppose,” said he with great solemnity, as soon as\n",
      "he was seated, “of the very shocking discovery that took place under\n",
      "our roof yesterday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your sister,” he continued, “has suffered dreadfully. Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "too—in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress—but I\n",
      "will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us\n",
      "quite overcome. Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday. But I\n",
      "would not alarm you too much. Donavan says there is nothing materially\n",
      "to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolution\n",
      "equal to any thing. She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an\n",
      "angel! She says she never shall think well of anybody again; and one\n",
      "cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!—meeting with such\n",
      "ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shown, so much confidence\n",
      "had been placed! It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that\n",
      "she had asked these young women to her house; merely because she\n",
      "thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved\n",
      "girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished\n",
      "very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your\n",
      "kind friend there, was attending her daughter. And now to be so\n",
      "rewarded! ‘I wish, with all my heart,’ says poor Fanny in her\n",
      "affectionate way, ‘that we had asked your sisters instead of them.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is\n",
      "not to be described. While she with the truest affection had been\n",
      "planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that\n",
      "he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!—such a\n",
      "suspicion could never have entered her head! If she suspected _any_\n",
      "prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in _that_ quarter. ‘_There_,\n",
      "to be sure,’ said she, ‘I might have thought myself safe.’ She was\n",
      "quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should be\n",
      "done, and at last she determined to send for Edward. He came. But I am\n",
      "sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make\n",
      "him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose\n",
      "by my arguments, and Fanny’s entreaties, was of no avail. Duty,\n",
      "affection, every thing was disregarded. I never thought Edward so\n",
      "stubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained to him her liberal\n",
      "designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle\n",
      "on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good\n",
      "thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew desperate, to make it\n",
      "twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he still persisted in\n",
      "this low connection, represented to him the certain penury that must\n",
      "attend the match. His own two thousand pounds she protested should be\n",
      "his all; she would never see him again; and so far would she be from\n",
      "affording him the smallest assistance, that if he were to enter into\n",
      "any profession with a view of better support, she would do all in her\n",
      "power to prevent him advancing in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands\n",
      "together, and cried, “Gracious God! can this be possible!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well may you wonder, Marianne,” replied her brother, “at the obstinacy\n",
      "which could resist such arguments as these. Your exclamation is very\n",
      "natural.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and\n",
      "forbore.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All this, however,” he continued, “was urged in vain. Edward said very\n",
      "little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner. Nothing\n",
      "should prevail on him to give up his engagement. He would stand to it,\n",
      "cost him what it might.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then,” cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be\n",
      "silent, “he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.\n",
      "Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a\n",
      "rascal. I have some little concern in the business, as well as\n",
      "yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a\n",
      "better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good\n",
      "husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not open\n",
      "to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially\n",
      "anybody of good fortune. He therefore replied, without any resentment,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward’s conduct, but only\n",
      "Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit. _They_ only knew how\n",
      "little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was the\n",
      "consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remain\n",
      "to him in the loss of friends and fortune. Elinor gloried in his\n",
      "integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his\n",
      "punishment. But though confidence between them was, by this public\n",
      "discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which\n",
      "either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor avoided it upon\n",
      "principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the too\n",
      "warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward’s\n",
      "continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; and\n",
      "Marianne’s courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic\n",
      "which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the\n",
      "comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor’s conduct and her\n",
      "own.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had\n",
      "hoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of\n",
      "continual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never\n",
      "exerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,\n",
      "without the hope of amendment. Her mind was so much weakened that she\n",
      "still fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only\n",
      "dispirited her more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs\n",
      "in Harley Street, or Bartlett’s Buildings. But though so much of the\n",
      "matter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had\n",
      "enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking after\n",
      "more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and\n",
      "inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the\n",
      "hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them\n",
      "within that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so\n",
      "fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,\n",
      "though it was only the second week in March. Mrs. Jennings and Elinor\n",
      "were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were\n",
      "again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather\n",
      "to stay at home, than venture into so public a place.\n",
      "\n",
      "An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they\n",
      "entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing\n",
      "with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings’s conversation, she was\n",
      "herself left to quiet reflection. She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,\n",
      "nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by\n",
      "any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her. But at last she\n",
      "found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who, though\n",
      "looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and\n",
      "on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their’s. Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get it all out of her, my dear. She will tell you any thing if you\n",
      "ask. You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings’s curiosity and Elinor’s too,\n",
      "that she would tell any thing _without_ being asked; for nothing would\n",
      "otherwise have been learnt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so glad to meet you;” said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by\n",
      "the arm—“for I wanted to see you of all things in the world.” And then\n",
      "lowering her voice, “I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it. Is\n",
      "she angry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all, I believe, with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is a good thing. And Lady Middleton, is _she_ angry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot suppose it possible that she should be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am monstrous glad of it. Good gracious! I have had such a time of\n",
      "it! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life. She vowed at first she\n",
      "would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me\n",
      "again, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are\n",
      "as good friends as ever. Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put\n",
      "in the feather last night. There now, _you_ are going to laugh at me\n",
      "too. But why should not I wear pink ribbons? I do not care if it _is_\n",
      "the Doctor’s favourite colour. I am sure, for my part, I should never\n",
      "have known he _did_ like it better than any other colour, if he had not\n",
      "happened to say so. My cousins have been so plaguing me! I declare\n",
      "sometimes I do not know which way to look before them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,\n",
      "and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to\n",
      "the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, but Miss Dashwood,” speaking triumphantly, “people may say what\n",
      "they chuse about Mr. Ferrars’s declaring he would not have Lucy, for it\n",
      "is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such\n",
      "ill-natured reports to be spread abroad. Whatever Lucy might think\n",
      "about it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set\n",
      "it down for certain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,”\n",
      "said Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, did not you? But it _was_ said, I know, very well, and by more\n",
      "than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses\n",
      "could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with\n",
      "thirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing\n",
      "at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my\n",
      "cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was\n",
      "afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us\n",
      "for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in\n",
      "my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your\n",
      "brother’s Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday,\n",
      "Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once\n",
      "Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that.\n",
      "However this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then\n",
      "it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,\n",
      "and been talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had\n",
      "declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but\n",
      "Lucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by what passed, that\n",
      "as soon as he had went away from his mother’s house, he had got upon\n",
      "his horse, and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he\n",
      "had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get\n",
      "the better of it. And after thinking it all over and over again, he\n",
      "said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at\n",
      "all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because\n",
      "it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds,\n",
      "and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he\n",
      "had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they\n",
      "to live upon that?—He could not bear to think of her doing no better,\n",
      "and so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to\n",
      "the matter directly, and leave him shift for himself. I heard him say\n",
      "all this as plain as could possibly be. And it was entirely for _her_\n",
      "sake, and upon _her_ account, that he said a word about being off, and\n",
      "not upon his own. I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of\n",
      "being tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing\n",
      "like it. But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of\n",
      "talking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and\n",
      "love, you know, and all that—Oh, la! one can’t repeat such kind of\n",
      "things you know)—she told him directly, she had not the least mind in\n",
      "the world to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how\n",
      "little so ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all,\n",
      "you know, or something of the kind. So then he was monstrous happy, and\n",
      "talked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he\n",
      "should take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he\n",
      "got a living. And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin\n",
      "called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and\n",
      "would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into\n",
      "the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but\n",
      "she did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a\n",
      "pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,” said Elinor;\n",
      "“you were all in the same room together, were not you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed, not us. La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love\n",
      "when any body else is by? Oh, for shame!—To be sure you must know\n",
      "better than that. (Laughing affectedly.)—No, no; they were shut up in\n",
      "the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at the\n",
      "door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How!” cried Elinor; “have you been repeating to me what you only\n",
      "learnt yourself by listening at the door? I am sorry I did not know it\n",
      "before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me\n",
      "particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known\n",
      "yourself. How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, la! there is nothing in _that_. I only stood at the door, and\n",
      "heard what I could. And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by\n",
      "me; for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many\n",
      "secrets together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or\n",
      "behind a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be\n",
      "kept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,” said she; “but now he is\n",
      "lodging at No.—, Pall Mall. What an ill-natured woman his mother is,\n",
      "an’t she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I\n",
      "shan’t say anything against them to _you;_ and to be sure they did send\n",
      "us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for. And for\n",
      "my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for\n",
      "the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however, nothing\n",
      "was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of sight. Edward\n",
      "have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go there for a\n",
      "time; and after _that_, as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will\n",
      "be ordained. I wonder what curacy he will get! Good gracious! (giggling\n",
      "as she spoke) I’d lay my life I know what my cousins will say, when\n",
      "they hear of it. They will tell me I should write to the Doctor, to get\n",
      "Edward the curacy of his new living. I know they will; but I am sure I\n",
      "would not do such a thing for all the world. ‘La!’ I shall say\n",
      "directly, ‘I wonder how you could think of such a thing? _I_ write to\n",
      "the Doctor, indeed!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Elinor, “it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst.\n",
      "You have got your answer ready.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach of\n",
      "her own party made another more necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, la! here come the Richardsons. I had a vast deal more to say to\n",
      "you, but I must not stay away from them not any longer. I assure you\n",
      "they are very genteel people. He makes a monstrous deal of money, and\n",
      "they keep their own coach. I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "about it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not\n",
      "in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything\n",
      "should happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "should want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay\n",
      "with her for as long a time as she likes. I suppose Lady Middleton\n",
      "won’t ask us any more this bout. Good-by; I am sorry Miss Marianne was\n",
      "not here. Remember me kindly to her. La! if you have not got your\n",
      "spotted muslin on!—I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was her parting concern; for after this, she had time only to pay\n",
      "her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company was\n",
      "claimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of\n",
      "knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, though\n",
      "she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and\n",
      "foreplanned in her own mind. Edward’s marriage with Lucy was as firmly\n",
      "determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely\n",
      "uncertain, as she had concluded it would be;—every thing depended,\n",
      "exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment, of\n",
      "which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for\n",
      "information; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible\n",
      "intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained, she\n",
      "confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, as\n",
      "she felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own consequence, would\n",
      "choose to have known. The continuance of their engagement, and the\n",
      "means that were able to be taken for promoting its end, was all her\n",
      "communication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following\n",
      "natural remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait for his having a living!—ay, we all know how _that_ will\n",
      "end:—they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it,\n",
      "will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest\n",
      "of his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr.\n",
      "Pratt can give her. Then they will have a child every year! and Lord\n",
      "help ’em! how poor they will be! I must see what I can give them\n",
      "towards furnishing their house. Two maids and two men, indeed! as I\n",
      "talked of t’ other day. No, no, they must get a stout girl of all\n",

      "The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from\n",

      "such a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after all the\n",
      "troubles we have went through lately, therefore will make no more\n",
      "apologies, but proceed to say that, thank God! though we have suffered\n",
      "dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy as we must always\n",
      "be in one another’s love. We have had great trials, and great\n",
      "persecutions, but however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge\n",
      "many friends, yourself not the least among them, whose great kindness I\n",

      "to blame for what she did, but she did it for the best, so I say\n",
      "nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won’t think it too much trouble to give us\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,\n",
      "and Marianne’s impatience to be gone increased every day. She sighed\n",
      "for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if\n",
      "any place could give her ease, Barton must do it. Elinor was hardly\n",
      "less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent\n",
      "on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the\n",
      "difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought\n",
      "to acknowledge. She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts\n",
      "towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to\n",
      "their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her\n",
      "good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from\n",
      "home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more\n",
      "eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about\n",
      "the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both\n",
      "her friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with\n",
      "them. This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy\n",
      "of Miss Dashwood;—but it was inforced with so much real politeness by\n",
      "Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his\n",
      "manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy,\n",
      "induced her to accept it with pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was\n",
      "not very auspicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cleveland!”—she cried, with great agitation. “No, I cannot go to\n",
      "Cleveland.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You forget,” said Elinor gently, “that its situation is not—that it is\n",
      "not in the neighbourhood of—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is in Somersetshire.—I cannot go into Somersetshire.—There,\n",
      "where I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to\n",
      "go there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such\n",
      "feelings;—she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on\n",
      "others;—represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the\n",
      "time of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished to\n",
      "see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan\n",
      "could do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, which\n",
      "was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not\n",
      "beyond one day, though a long day’s journey; and their mother’s servant\n",
      "might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no\n",
      "occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be\n",
      "at home in little more than three weeks’ time. As Marianne’s affection\n",
      "for her mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty,\n",
      "over the imaginary evils she had started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guests, that she\n",
      "pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland.\n",
      "Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her\n",
      "design; and their mother’s concurrence being readily gained, every\n",
      "thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;—and\n",
      "Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that\n",
      "were yet to divide her from Barton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss\n",
      "Dashwoods;”—was Mrs. Jennings’s address to him when he first called on\n",
      "her, after their leaving her was settled—“for they are quite resolved\n",
      "upon going home from the Palmers;—and how forlorn we shall be, when I\n",
      "come back!—Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two\n",
      "cats.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their\n",
      "future ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give\n",
      "himself an escape from it; and if so, she had soon afterwards good\n",
      "reason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor’s moving to the\n",
      "window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she\n",
      "was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look of\n",
      "particular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes.\n",
      "The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her\n",
      "observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even\n",
      "changed her seat, on purpose that she might _not_ hear, to one close by\n",
      "the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep\n",
      "herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with\n",
      "agitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.\n",
      "Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval of\n",
      "Marianne’s turning from one lesson to another, some words of the\n",
      "Colonel’s inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be\n",
      "apologising for the badness of his house. This set the matter beyond a\n",
      "doubt. She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so; but\n",
      "supposed it to be the proper etiquette. What Elinor said in reply she\n",
      "could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that she\n",
      "did not think _that_ any material objection; and Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "commended her in her heart for being so honest. They then talked on for\n",
      "a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another\n",
      "lucky stop in Marianne’s performance brought her these words in the\n",
      "Colonel’s calm voice,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost\n",
      "ready to cry out, “Lord! what should hinder it?”—but checking her\n",
      "desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is very strange!—sure he need not wait to be older.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This delay on the Colonel’s side, however, did not seem to offend or\n",
      "mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the\n",
      "conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which showed her to\n",
      "feel what she said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that\n",
      "after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leave\n",
      "of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost _sang-froid_, and go\n",
      "away without making her any reply! She had not thought her old friend\n",
      "could have made so indifferent a suitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "What had really passed between them was to this effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have heard,” said he, with great compassion, “of the injustice your\n",
      "friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand\n",
      "the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering\n",
      "in his engagement with a very deserving young woman. Have I been\n",
      "rightly informed? Is it so?;”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor told him that it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,” he replied, with great feeling,\n",
      "“of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long attached\n",
      "to each other, is terrible. Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be\n",
      "doing—what she may drive her son to. I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or\n",
      "three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with him. He is not a\n",
      "young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time,\n",
      "but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake, and as\n",
      "a friend of yours, I wish it still more. I understand that he intends\n",
      "to take orders. Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of\n",
      "Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this day’s post, is his,\n",
      "if he think it worth his acceptance; but _that_, perhaps, so\n",
      "unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be nonsense to appear\n",
      "to doubt; I only wish it were more valuable. It is a rectory, but a\n",
      "small one; the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than 200£\n",
      "per annum, and though it is certainly capable of improvement, I fear,\n",
      "not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income. Such\n",
      "as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting it to him, will be very\n",
      "great. Pray assure him of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor’s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been\n",
      "greater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand.\n",
      "The preferment, which only two days before she had considered as\n",
      "hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry; and\n",
      "_she_, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it! Her\n",
      "emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different\n",
      "cause; but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have\n",
      "a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence, and\n",
      "her gratitude for the particular friendship, which together prompted\n",
      "Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly expressed.\n",
      "She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward’s principles\n",
      "and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve; and\n",
      "promised to undertake the commission with pleasure, if it were really\n",
      "his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another. But at the same\n",
      "time, she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it\n",
      "as himself. It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give\n",
      "Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from _her_, she would have\n",
      "been very glad to be spared herself; but Colonel Brandon, on motives of\n",
      "equal delicacy, declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its\n",
      "being given through her means, that she would not on any account make\n",
      "farther opposition. Edward, she believed, was still in town, and\n",
      "fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele. She could\n",
      "undertake therefore to inform him of it, in the course of the day.\n",
      "After this had been settled, Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own\n",
      "advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and\n",
      "_then_ it was that he mentioned with regret, that the house was small\n",
      "and indifferent; an evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed\n",
      "her to do, made very light of, at least as far as regarded its size.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The smallness of the house,” said she, “I cannot imagine any\n",
      "inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and\n",
      "income.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By which the Colonel was surprised to find that _she_ was considering\n",
      "Mr. Ferrars’s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation;\n",
      "for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply\n",
      "such an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle\n",
      "on, and he said so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This little rectory _can_ do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable\n",
      "as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry. I am sorry to say that my\n",
      "patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive. If,\n",
      "however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him\n",
      "farther, I must think very differently of him from what I now do, if I\n",
      "am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be\n",
      "at present. What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all, since it\n",
      "can advance him so little towards what must be his principal, his only\n",
      "object of happiness. His marriage must still be a distant good; at\n",
      "least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended the\n",
      "delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of what\n",
      "really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at\n",
      "the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may\n",
      "perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less\n",
      "properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, Miss Dashwood,” said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as soon\n",
      "as the gentleman had withdrawn, “I do not ask you what the Colonel has\n",
      "been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I _tried_ to keep out\n",
      "of hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand his\n",
      "business. And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I\n",
      "wish you joy of it with all my heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, ma’am,” said Elinor. “It _is_ a matter of great joy to me;\n",
      "and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. There are not\n",
      "many men who would act as he has done. Few people who have so\n",
      "compassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord! my dear, you are very modest. I an’t the least astonished at it\n",
      "in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more\n",
      "likely to happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel’s general benevolence;\n",
      "but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very\n",
      "soon occur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Opportunity!” repeated Mrs. Jennings—“Oh! as to that, when a man has\n",
      "once made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon\n",
      "find an opportunity. Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and\n",
      "again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I\n",
      "shall soon know where to look for them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,” said Elinor, with a\n",
      "faint smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed. And as to the house being a bad one,\n",
      "I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as\n",
      "ever I saw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He spoke of its being out of repair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, and whose fault is that? why don’t he repair it?—who should do\n",
      "it but himself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were interrupted by the servant’s coming in to announce the\n",
      "carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to\n",
      "go, said,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out. But,\n",
      "however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be quite\n",
      "alone. I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too\n",
      "full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must long to\n",
      "tell your sister all about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne had left the room before the conversation began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, ma’am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not mention\n",
      "it at present to any body else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! very well,” said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed. “Then you\n",
      "would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as\n",
      "Holborn to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, ma’am, not even Lucy if you please. One day’s delay will not be\n",
      "very material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought\n",
      "not to be mentioned to any body else. I shall do _that_ directly. It is\n",
      "of importance that no time should be lost with him, for he will of\n",
      "course have much to do relative to his ordination.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly. Why Mr. Ferrars\n",
      "was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she could not\n",
      "immediately comprehend. A few moments’ reflection, however, produced a\n",
      "very happy idea, and she exclaimed;—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, ho!—I understand you. Mr. Ferrars is to be the man. Well, so much\n",
      "the better for him. Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in readiness;\n",
      "and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you. But, my\n",
      "dear, is not this rather out of character? Should not the Colonel write\n",
      "himself?—sure, he is the proper person.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings’s\n",
      "speech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore\n",
      "only replied to its conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one to\n",
      "announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so _you_ are forced to do it. Well _that_ is an odd kind of\n",
      "delicacy! However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to\n",
      "write.) You know your own concerns best. So goodby, my dear. I have not\n",
      "heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to\n",
      "bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And away she went; but returning again in a moment,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have just been thinking of Betty’s sister, my dear. I should be very\n",
      "glad to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do for a\n",
      "lady’s maid, I am sure I can’t tell. She is an excellent housemaid, and\n",
      "works very well at her needle. However, you will think of all that at\n",
      "your leisure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, ma’am,” replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said,\n",
      "and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "How she should begin—how she should express herself in her note to\n",
      "Edward, was now all her concern. The particular circumstances between\n",
      "them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have\n",
      "been the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too\n",
      "much or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen\n",
      "in her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he\n",
      "came to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not\n",
      "returning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss\n",
      "Dashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular\n",
      "business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her\n",
      "perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself\n",
      "properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the\n",
      "information by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her\n",
      "upon this greatest exertion of all. Her astonishment and confusion were\n",
      "very great on his so sudden appearance. She had not seen him before\n",
      "since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his knowing\n",
      "her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of what she\n",
      "had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her feel\n",
      "particularly uncomfortable for some minutes. He too was much\n",
      "distressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of\n",
      "embarrassment.—Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on\n",
      "first coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to\n",
      "be on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could\n",
      "say any thing, after taking a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Jennings told me,” said he, “that you wished to speak with me, at\n",
      "least I understood her so—or I certainly should not have intruded on\n",
      "you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been\n",
      "extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;\n",
      "especially as it will most likely be some time—it is not probable that\n",
      "I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again. I go to Oxford\n",
      "tomorrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You would not have gone, however,” said Elinor, recovering herself,\n",
      "and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as\n",
      "possible, “without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been\n",
      "able to give them in person. Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she\n",
      "said. I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on\n",
      "the point of communicating by paper. I am charged with a most agreeable\n",
      "office (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.) Colonel\n",
      "Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say, that\n",
      "understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure in\n",
      "offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishes it\n",
      "were more valuable. Allow me to congratulate you on having so\n",
      "respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that the\n",
      "living—it is about two hundred a-year—were much more considerable, and\n",
      "such as might better enable you to—as might be more than a temporary\n",
      "accommodation to yourself—such, in short, as might establish all your\n",
      "views of happiness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be expected\n",
      "that any one else should say for him. He _looked_ all the astonishment\n",
      "which such unexpected, such unthought-of information could not fail of\n",
      "exciting; but he said only these two words,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Colonel Brandon!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the\n",
      "worst was over, “Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern\n",
      "for what has lately passed—for the cruel situation in which the\n",
      "unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you—a concern which I\n",
      "am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; and\n",
      "likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character, and\n",
      "his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Colonel Brandon give _me_ a living!—Can it be possible?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find\n",
      "friendship any where.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied he, with sudden consciousness, “not to find it in _you;_\n",
      "for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.—I\n",
      "feel it—I would express it if I could—but, as you well know, I am no\n",
      "orator.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very much mistaken. I do assure you that you owe it entirely,\n",
      "at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon’s\n",
      "discernment of it. I have had no hand in it. I did not even know, till\n",
      "I understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it ever\n",
      "occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift. As a\n",
      "friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps—indeed I know he _has_,\n",
      "still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe\n",
      "nothing to my solicitation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but\n",
      "she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of\n",
      "Edward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably\n",
      "contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently\n",
      "entered it. For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had\n",
      "ceased to speak;—at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability. I have\n",
      "always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems him\n",
      "highly. He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners perfectly\n",
      "the gentleman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed,” replied Elinor, “I believe that you will find him, on farther\n",
      "acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you will be\n",
      "such very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is almost\n",
      "close to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that he\n",
      "_should_ be all this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her\n",
      "a look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he\n",
      "might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the\n",
      "mansion-house much greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,” said he, soon\n",
      "afterwards, rising from his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor told him the number of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not\n",
      "allow me to give _you;_ to assure him that he has made me a very—an\n",
      "exceedingly happy man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, with a very\n",
      "earnest assurance on _her_ side of her unceasing good wishes for his\n",
      "happiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on _his_,\n",
      "with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power of\n",
      "expressing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I see him again,” said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him\n",
      "out, “I shall see him the husband of Lucy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the\n",
      "past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of\n",
      "Edward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people\n",
      "whom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a\n",
      "great deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important\n",
      "secret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to\n",
      "it again as soon as Elinor appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, my dear,” she cried, “I sent you up the young man. Did not I do\n",
      "right?—And I suppose you had no great difficulty—You did not find him\n",
      "very unwilling to accept your proposal?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, ma’am; _that_ was not very likely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, and how soon will he be ready?—For it seems all to depend upon\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really,” said Elinor, “I know so little of these kind of forms, that I\n",
      "can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation\n",
      "necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his\n",
      "ordination.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two or three months!” cried Mrs. Jennings; “Lord! my dear, how calmly\n",
      "you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord\n",
      "bless me!—I am sure it would put _me_ quite out of patience!—And though\n",
      "one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think\n",
      "it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him. Sure\n",
      "somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in\n",
      "orders already.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear ma’am,” said Elinor, “what can you be thinking of? Why,\n",
      "Colonel Brandon’s only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord bless you, my dear! Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the\n",
      "Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.\n",
      "Ferrars!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The deception could not continue after this; and an explanation\n",
      "immediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for\n",
      "the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still\n",
      "without forfeiting her expectation of the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,” said she, after the first\n",
      "ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, “and very likely\n",
      "_may_ be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I thought,\n",
      "for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the\n",
      "ground-floor, and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen\n",
      "beds! and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage! It\n",
      "seems quite ridiculous. But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to\n",
      "do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them,\n",
      "before Lucy goes to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living’s\n",
      "being enough to allow them to marry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year\n",
      "himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less. Take my word for\n",
      "it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford\n",
      "Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan’t go if Lucy an’t\n",
      "there.”\n",

      "CHAPTER XLI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with\n",
      "his happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he\n",
      "reached Bartlett’s Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, who called on her again the next day with her\n",
      "congratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in\n",
      "her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain; and\n",
      "she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their\n",
      "being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.\n",
      "So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinor\n",
      "that credit which Edward _would_ give her, that she spoke of her\n",
      "friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready to\n",
      "own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no exertion\n",
      "for their good on Miss Dashwood’s part, either present or future, would\n",
      "ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing any thing in\n",
      "the world for those she really valued. As for Colonel Brandon, she was\n",
      "not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was moreover truly\n",
      "anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;\n",
      "anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and secretly\n",
      "resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she possibly could,\n",
      "of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley\n",
      "Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his\n",
      "wife’s indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel\n",
      "it necessary to pay her a visit.—This was an obligation, however, which\n",
      "not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the assistance\n",
      "of any encouragement from her companions. Marianne, not contented with\n",
      "absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to prevent her\n",
      "sister’s going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her carriage was\n",
      "always at Elinor’s service, so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood,\n",
      "that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late\n",
      "discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward’s\n",
      "part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again. The\n",
      "consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit, for\n",
      "which no one could really have less inclination, and to run the risk of\n",
      "a tête-à-tête with a woman, whom neither of the others had so much\n",
      "reason to dislike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the\n",
      "house, her husband accidentally came out. He expressed great pleasure\n",
      "in meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in\n",
      "Berkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see\n",
      "her, invited her to come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.—Nobody was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,” said he: “I will go to her\n",
      "presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the\n",
      "world to seeing _you_. Very far from it, indeed. _Now_ especially there\n",
      "cannot be—but however, you and Marianne were always great favourites.\n",
      "Why would not Marianne come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor made what excuse she could for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not sorry to see you alone,” he replied, “for I have a good deal\n",
      "to say to you. This living of Colonel Brandon’s—can it be true?—has he\n",
      "really given it to Edward?—I heard it yesterday by chance, and was\n",
      "coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is perfectly true.—Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford\n",
      "to Edward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really!—Well, this is very astonishing!—no relationship!—no connection\n",
      "between them!—and now that livings fetch such a price!—what was the\n",
      "value of this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“About two hundred a year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well—and for the next presentation to a living of that\n",
      "value—supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and\n",
      "likely to vacate it soon—he might have got I dare say—fourteen hundred\n",
      "pounds. And how came he not to have settled that matter before this\n",
      "person’s death? _Now_, indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a\n",
      "man of Colonel Brandon’s sense! I wonder he should be so improvident in\n",
      "a point of such common, such natural, concern! Well, I am convinced\n",
      "that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human\n",
      "character. I suppose, however—on recollection—that the case may\n",
      "probably be _this_. Edward is only to hold the living till the person\n",
      "to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to\n",
      "take it. Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that\n",
      "she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel\n",
      "Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which\n",
      "it was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is truly astonishing!”—he cried, after hearing what she said—“what\n",
      "could be the Colonel’s motive?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A very simple one—to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky\n",
      "man.—You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I\n",
      "have broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,—she will not like\n",
      "to hear it much talked of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she\n",
      "thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth\n",
      "to her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be possibly\n",
      "impoverished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Ferrars,” added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so\n",
      "important a subject, “knows nothing about it at present, and I believe\n",
      "it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may\n",
      "be. When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why should such precaution be used? Though it is not to be\n",
      "supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in\n",
      "knowing that her son has money enough to live upon, for _that_ must be\n",
      "quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she\n",
      "supposed to feel at all? She has done with her son,—she cast him off\n",
      "for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast\n",
      "him off likewise. Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable\n",
      "to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account: she cannot be\n",
      "interested in any thing that befalls him. She would not be so weak as\n",
      "to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a\n",
      "parent!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Elinor,” said John, “your reasoning is very good, but it is\n",
      "founded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward’s unhappy match takes\n",
      "place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never\n",
      "discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate\n",
      "that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory\n",
      "by _this_ time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You wrong her exceedingly. Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most\n",
      "affectionate mothers in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We think _now_,”—said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, “of\n",
      "_Robert’s_ marrying Miss Morton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother’s\n",
      "tone, calmly replied,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Choice!—how do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be\n",
      "the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all\n",
      "intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;—and as to any\n",
      "thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that\n",
      "one is superior to the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.—His\n",
      "reflections ended thus.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of _one_ thing, my dear sister,” kindly taking her hand, and speaking\n",
      "in an awful whisper, “I may assure you;—and I _will_ do it, because I\n",
      "know it must gratify you. I have good reason to think—indeed I have it\n",
      "from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it\n",
      "would be very wrong to say any thing about it,—but I have it from the\n",
      "very best authority,—not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say\n",
      "it herself—but her daughter _did_, and I have it from her,—that in\n",
      "short, whatever objections there might be against a certain—a certain\n",
      "connection, you understand me,—it would have been far preferable to\n",
      "her,—it would not have given her half the vexation that _this_ does. I\n",
      "was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that\n",
      "light; a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all. ‘It would\n",
      "have been beyond comparison,’ she said, ‘the least evil of the two, and\n",
      "she would be glad to compound _now_ for nothing worse.’ But however,\n",
      "all that is quite out of the question,—not to be thought of or\n",
      "mentioned—as to any attachment you know, it never could be: all that is\n",
      "gone by. But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I knew\n",
      "how much it must please you. Not that you have any reason to regret, my\n",
      "dear Elinor. There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well,—quite as\n",
      "well, or better, perhaps, all things considered. Has Colonel Brandon\n",
      "been with you lately?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her\n",
      "self-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;—and she was\n",

      "herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her\n",
      "brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars. After a few moments’\n",
      "chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her\n",

      "unfair a division of his mother’s love and liberality, to the prejudice\n",
      "of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course of\n",

      "most immoderately. The idea of Edward’s being a clergyman, and living\n",
      "in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;—and when to\n",
      "that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a\n",
      "white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith\n",
      "and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the\n",
      "conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed\n",
      "on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited. It was a\n",
      "look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,\n",
      "and gave no intelligence to him. He was recalled from wit to wisdom,\n",
      "not by any reproof of hers, but by his own sensibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We may treat it as a joke,” said he, at last, recovering from the\n",
      "affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety\n",
      "of the moment; “but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business. Poor\n",
      "Edward! he is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for it; for I know\n",
      "him to be a very good-hearted creature; as well-meaning a fellow\n",
      "perhaps, as any in the world. You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood,\n",
      "from _your_ slight acquaintance. Poor Edward! His manners are certainly\n",
      "not the happiest in nature. But we are not all born, you know, with the\n",
      "same powers,—the same address. Poor fellow! to see him in a circle of\n",
      "strangers! To be sure it was pitiable enough; but upon my soul, I\n",
      "believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom; and I declare and\n",
      "protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as when it all burst\n",
      "forth. I could not believe it. My mother was the first person who told\n",
      "me of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution,\n",
      "immediately said to her, ‘My dear madam, I do not know what you may\n",
      "intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must say, that if\n",
      "Edward does marry this young woman, _I_ never will see him again.’ That\n",
      "was what I said immediately. I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!\n",
      "Poor Edward! he has done for himself completely,—shut himself out for\n",
      "ever from all decent society! But, as I directly said to my mother, I\n",
      "am not in the least surprised at it; from his style of education, it\n",

      "country girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty. I\n",
      "remember her perfectly. Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely\n",
      "to captivate poor Edward. I offered immediately, as soon as my mother\n",
      "related the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade him from\n",
      "the match; but it was too late _then_, I found, to do any thing, for\n",
      "unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it till\n",
      "after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you know, to\n",
      "interfere. But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier, I think\n",
      "it is most probable that something might have been hit on. I certainly\n",
      "should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light. ‘My dear\n",
      "fellow,’ I should have said, ‘consider what you are doing. You are\n",
      "making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one as your family are\n",
      "unanimous in disapproving.’ I cannot help thinking, in short, that\n",

      "starved, you know, that is certain; absolutely starved.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance\n",
      "of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject. But though _she_ never\n",

      "her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she\n",
      "entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself. She\n",
      "even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her\n",

      "walls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child\n",
      "to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through the\n",

      "wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude, she\n",
      "resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained\n",

      "She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house,\n",
      "on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the rest of\n",

      "garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the\n",
      "gardener’s lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the\n",
      "green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed,\n",
      "and nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of\n",

      "hopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or being stolen\n",
      "by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood, she\n",

      "prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner. She had\n",
      "depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all over\n",
      "the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred\n",
      "her from it; but a heavy and settled rain even _she_ could not fancy\n",
      "dry or pleasant weather for walking.\n",

      "and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther\n",

      "in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by the\n",
      "family in general, soon procured herself a book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer’s side that constant and friendly\n",
      "good humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome. The\n",
      "openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of\n",
      "recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms\n",

      "however, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,\n",
      "and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found him\n",
      "very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from\n",
      "being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much\n",
      "superior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings and Charlotte. For the rest of his character and habits, they\n",
      "were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all\n",
      "unusual in his sex and time of life. He was nice in his eating,\n",
      "uncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight\n",
      "it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been\n",
      "devoted to business. She liked him, however, upon the whole, much\n",
      "better than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she\n",
      "could like him no more;—not sorry to be driven by the observation of\n",
      "his Epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with\n",
      "complacency on the remembrance of Edward’s generous temper, simple\n",

      "her in this, as well as in every other particular, his open pleasure in\n",
      "meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his readiness to\n",
      "converse with her, and his deference for her opinion, might very well\n",

      "been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the first, believed\n",
      "Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it herself. But as it\n",
      "was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head, except by Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings’s suggestion; and she could not help believing herself the\n",
      "nicest observer of the two;—she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "thought only of his behaviour;—and while his looks of anxious\n",
      "solicitude on Marianne’s feeling, in her head and throat, the beginning\n",
      "of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words, entirely escaped the\n",

      "over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read, or\n",

      "few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised, at\n",
      "her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two; and whither she was\n",
      "almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her. Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,\n",
      "declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as\n",
      "Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her own attentive care,\n",
      "to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from; and\n",
      "Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,\n",
      "desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her better\n",

      "The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the\n",

      "who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings’s forebodings, was\n",
      "not in a state of mind to resist their influence. He tried to reason\n",

      "both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared\n",
      "his patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every\n",
      "symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed\n",
      "in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her\n",
      "letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than her\n",
      "friend’s, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them\n",
      "at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able\n",
      "to travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began. Towards the\n",
      "evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and\n",
      "uncomfortable than before. Her sister, however, still sanguine, was\n",
      "willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of\n",
      "having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the\n",
      "cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a\n",
      "slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Her\n",
      "sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a\n",
      "considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she\n",
      "resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings, knowing\n",
      "nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed; her\n",
      "maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating herself in\n",
      "the housekeeper’s room, and Elinor remained alone with Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her\n",
      "sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change of\n",
      "posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint\n",
      "which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful\n",
      "a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in\n",
      "the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness, cried out,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is mama coming?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not yet,” cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting\n",
      "Marianne to lie down again, “but she will be here, I hope, before it is\n",
      "long. It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she must not go round by London,” cried Marianne, in the same\n",
      "hurried manner. “I shall never see her, if she goes by London.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while\n",
      "attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse. It was lower and\n",
      "quicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her\n",
      "alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly\n",
      "for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother.\n",
      "To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the\n",
      "latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its\n",
      "performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by\n",
      "her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he\n",
      "was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was no time for hesitation. Her fears and her difficulties were\n",
      "immediately before him. Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to\n",
      "attempt the removal of:—he listened to them in silent despondence;—but\n",
      "her difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that\n",
      "seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his mind,\n",
      "he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.\n",
      "Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She thanked him\n",
      "with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to hurry off\n",
      "his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for post-horses\n",
      "directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon—or such\n",
      "a companion for her mother,—how gratefully was it felt!—a companion\n",
      "whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve, and whose\n",
      "friendship might soothe her!—as far as the shock of such a summons\n",
      "_could_ be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,\n",
      "would lessen it.\n",
      "\n",
      "_He_, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness of\n",
      "a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost\n",
      "despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might\n",
      "look for his return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The\n",
      "horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon\n",
      "only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spoken\n",
      "too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage. It was then about\n",
      "twelve o’clock, and she returned to her sister’s apartment to wait for\n",
      "the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of the\n",
      "night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both. Hour after\n",
      "hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne’s side, and\n",
      "in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor’s, before Mr. Harris appeared. Her\n",
      "apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her former\n",
      "security; and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allow\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of what\n",
      "her mistress had always thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne’s ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her\n",
      "mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the\n",
      "heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with\n",
      "so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,\n",
      "fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had\n",
      "been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother\n",
      "arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if _he_ could\n",
      "not come, for some other advice, when the former—but not till after\n",
      "five o’clock—arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends for\n",
      "his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant\n",
      "alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to be\n",
      "material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must\n",
      "procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was communicated\n",
      "to Elinor. He promised to call again in the course of three or four\n",
      "hours, and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more\n",
      "composed than he had found them.\n",
      "\n",
      "With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to\n",
      "their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.\n",
      "Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her no\n",
      "doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her\n",
      "conviction of her sister’s danger would not allow her to offer the\n",
      "comfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the\n",
      "early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck\n",
      "a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings’s compassion\n",
      "she had other claims. She had been for three months her companion, was\n",
      "still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured,\n",
      "and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too, particularly a\n",
      "favourite, was before her;—and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "considered that Marianne might probably be to _her_ what Charlotte was\n",
      "to herself, her sympathy in _her_ sufferings was very sincere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;—but he came to be\n",
      "disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. His medicines\n",
      "had failed;—the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet—not\n",
      "more herself—remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching all, and more\n",
      "than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in further advice.\n",
      "But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something more to try, some\n",
      "more fresh application, of whose success he was as confident as the\n",
      "last, and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached\n",
      "the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood. She was calm,\n",
      "except when she thought of her mother; but she was almost hopeless; and\n",
      "in this state she continued till noon, scarcely stirring from her\n",
      "sister’s bed, her thoughts wandering from one image of grief, one\n",
      "suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by\n",
      "the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who scrupled not to attribute the\n",
      "severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous\n",
      "indisposition which Marianne’s disappointment had brought on. Elinor\n",
      "felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it gave fresh misery to\n",
      "her reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "About noon, however, she began—but with a caution—a dread of\n",
      "disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her\n",
      "friend—to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her\n",
      "sister’s pulse;—she waited, watched, and examined it again and\n",
      "again;—and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under\n",
      "exterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to\n",
      "communicate her hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to\n",
      "acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from\n",
      "indulging a thought of its continuance;—and Elinor, conning over every\n",
      "injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was\n",
      "too late. Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious\n",
      "flutter, she bent over her sister to watch—she hardly knew for what.\n",
      "Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her.\n",
      "Others even arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all\n",
      "flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes\n",
      "on her with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now\n",
      "oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity\n",
      "till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o’clock;—when his assurances,\n",
      "his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his\n",
      "expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her\n",
      "entirely out of danger. Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the\n",
      "partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their\n",
      "late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\n",
      "with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the\n",
      "probability of an entire recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not be cheerful. Her joy was of a different kind, and led\n",
      "to any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health,\n",
      "friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with\n",
      "sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent\n",
      "gratitude;—but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words, no\n",
      "smiles. All within Elinor’s breast was satisfaction, silent and strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the\n",
      "whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her\n",
      "enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every\n",
      "look and every breath. The possibility of a relapse would of course, in\n",
      "some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was—but when she saw,\n",
      "on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of recovery\n",
      "continued, and saw Marianne at six o’clock sink into a quiet, steady,\n",
      "and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected\n",
      "back. At ten o’clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her\n",
      "mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must\n",
      "now be travelling towards them. The Colonel, too!—perhaps scarcely less\n",
      "an object of pity!—Oh!—how slow was the progress of time which yet kept\n",
      "them in ignorance!\n",
      "\n",
      "At seven o’clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she had been\n",
      "kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating\n",
      "much;—and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of\n",
      "content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before\n",
      "her mother’s arrival, and allow _her_ to take her place by Marianne;\n",
      "but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that\n",
      "moment about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an\n",
      "unnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs\n",
      "into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\n",
      "left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to her\n",
      "own room to write letters and sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, and the\n",
      "rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,\n",
      "regarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and the\n",
      "travellers—they had a rich reward in store, for every present\n",
      "inconvenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been\n",
      "convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the\n",
      "house; and so strong was the persuasion that she _did_, in spite of the\n",
      "_almost_ impossibility of their being already come, that she moved into\n",
      "the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be\n",
      "satisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not\n",
      "deceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.\n",
      "By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn\n",
      "by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor mother’s\n",
      "alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at\n",
      "that moment. The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the\n",
      "carriage stopt at the door—of her doubt—her dread—perhaps her\n",
      "despair!—and of what _she_ had to tell!—with such knowledge it was\n",
      "impossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy;\n",
      "and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings’s maid\n",
      "with her sister, she hurried down stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,\n",
      "assured her that they were already in the house. She rushed to the\n",
      "drawing-room,—she entered it,—and saw only Willoughby.\n",

      "CHAPTER XLIV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him, obeyed\n",
      "the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room,\n",
      "and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by\n",
      "his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than\n",
      "supplication,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Dashwood, for half an hour—for ten minutes—I entreat you to\n",
      "stay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir,” she replied with firmness, “I shall _not_ stay. Your\n",
      "business cannot be with _me_. The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell\n",
      "you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Had they told me,” he cried with vehemence, “that Mr. Palmer and all\n",
      "his relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the\n",
      "door. My business is with you, and only you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With me!”—in the utmost amazement—“well, sir,—be quick—and if you\n",
      "can—less violent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sit down, and I will be both.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She hesitated; she knew not what to do. The possibility of Colonel\n",
      "Brandon’s arriving and finding her there, came across her. But she had\n",
      "promised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was\n",
      "engaged. After a moment’s recollection, therefore, concluding that\n",
      "prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best\n",
      "promote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down. He\n",
      "took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by\n",
      "either.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray be quick, sir,”—said Elinor, impatiently;—“I have no time to\n",
      "spare.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to\n",
      "hear her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your sister,” said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards—“is out of\n",
      "danger. I heard it from the servant. God be praised!—But is it true? is\n",
      "it really true?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor would not speak. He repeated the inquiry with yet greater\n",
      "eagerness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For God’s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We hope she is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose up, and walked across the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Had I known as much half an hour ago;—but since I _am_ here,” speaking\n",
      "with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat,—“what does it\n",
      "signify? For once, Miss Dashwood—it will be the last time, perhaps—let\n",
      "us be cheerful together. I am in a fine mood for gaiety. Tell me\n",
      "honestly” a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks, “do you think me most\n",
      "a knave or a fool?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever. She began to\n",
      "think that he must be in liquor;—the strangeness of such a visit, and\n",
      "of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this\n",
      "impression she immediately rose, saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe. I am not\n",
      "at leisure to remain with you longer. Whatever your business may be\n",
      "with me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand you,” he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice\n",
      "perfectly calm; “yes, I am very drunk. A pint of porter with my cold\n",
      "beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At Marlborough!”—cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand\n",
      "what he would be at.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,—I left London this morning at eight o’clock, and the only ten\n",
      "minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a\n",
      "nuncheon at Marlborough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he\n",
      "spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might\n",
      "bring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she\n",
      "said, after a moment’s recollection,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Willoughby, you _ought_ to feel, and I certainly _do_, that after\n",
      "what has passed, your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself\n",
      "upon my notice, requires a very particular excuse. What is it, that you\n",
      "mean by it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean,” said he, with serious energy, “if I can, to make you hate me\n",
      "one degree less than you do _now_. I mean to offer some kind of\n",
      "explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart\n",
      "to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a\n",
      "blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like\n",
      "forgiveness from Ma— from your sister.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is this the real reason of your coming?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my soul it is,”—was his answer, with a warmth which brought all\n",
      "the former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made\n",
      "her think him sincere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that is all, you may be satisfied already; for Marianne _does_, she\n",
      "has _long_ forgiven you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Has she?” he cried, in the same eager tone. “Then she has forgiven me\n",
      "before she ought to have done it. But she shall forgive me again, and\n",
      "on more reasonable grounds. _Now_ will you listen to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor bowed her assent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know,” said he, after a pause of expectation on her side, and\n",
      "thoughtfulness on his own, “how _you_ may have accounted for my\n",
      "behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have\n",
      "imputed to me. Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,—it is\n",
      "worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing. When I first\n",
      "became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view\n",
      "in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged\n",
      "to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.\n",
      "Your sister’s lovely person and interesting manners could not but\n",
      "please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a\n",
      "kind—it is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what _she_\n",
      "was, that my heart should have been so insensible! But at first I must\n",
      "confess, my vanity only was elevated by it. Careless of her happiness,\n",
      "thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had\n",
      "always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every\n",
      "means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any design\n",

      "\n",
      "“It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for me\n",
      "to listen any longer. Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by\n",
      "any thing. Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the\n",

      "“I insist on you hearing the whole of it,” he replied, “My fortune was\n",
      "never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of\n",
      "associating with people of better income than myself. Every year since\n",
      "my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and\n",
      "though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet\n",
      "that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for\n",
      "some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a\n",
      "woman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not a\n",
      "thing to be thought of; and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty,\n",
      "which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss Dashwood,\n",
      "can ever reprobate too much,—I was acting in this manner, trying to\n",
      "engage her regard, without a thought of returning it. But one thing may\n",
      "be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity, I did not\n",
      "know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I did not _then_\n",
      "know what it was to love. But have I ever known it? Well may it be\n",
      "doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings\n",
      "to vanity, to avarice? or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?\n",
      "But I have done it. To avoid a comparative poverty, which her affection\n",
      "and her society would have deprived of all its horrors, I have, by\n",
      "raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that could make it a\n",
      "blessing.”\n",

      "“You did then,” said Elinor, a little softened, “believe yourself at\n",
      "one time attached to her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness!\n",
      "Is there a man on earth who could have done it? Yes, I found myself, by\n",
      "insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my\n",
      "life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly\n",
      "honourable, and my feelings blameless. Even _then_, however, when fully\n",
      "determined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself most\n",
      "improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it, from an\n",
      "unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were\n",
      "so greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here—nor will I stop for\n",
      "_you_ to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of\n",
      "scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound. The\n",
      "event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with great\n",
      "circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible\n",
      "and wretched for ever. At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I\n",
      "had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone, to justify the\n",
      "attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly assure her of an\n",
      "affection which I had already taken such pains to display. But in the\n",
      "interim—in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before\n",
      "I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private—a\n",
      "circumstance occurred—an unlucky circumstance, to ruin all my\n",
      "resolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took place,”—here\n",
      "he hesitated and looked down. “Mrs. Smith had somehow or other been\n",
      "informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest it was to\n",
      "deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection—but I need not\n",
      "explain myself farther,” he added, looking at her with an heightened\n",

      "probably heard the whole story long ago.”\n",
      "\n",

      "anew against any compassion for him, “I have heard it all. And how you\n",
      "will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I\n",
      "confess is beyond my comprehension.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remember,” cried Willoughby, “from whom you received the account.\n",
      "Could it be an impartial one? I acknowledge that her situation and her\n",
      "character ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justify\n",
      "myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have\n",
      "nothing to urge—that because she was injured she was irreproachable,\n",
      "and because _I_ was a libertine, _she_ must be a saint. If the violence\n",
      "of her passions, the weakness of her understanding—I do not mean,\n",
      "however, to defend myself. Her affection for me deserved better\n",
      "treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness\n",
      "which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return. I\n",
      "wish—I heartily wish it had never been. But I have injured more than\n",
      "herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me (may I say it?)\n",
      "was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind—Oh! how infinitely\n",
      "superior!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl—I must say\n",
      "it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well\n",
      "be—your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her. Do\n",
      "not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of\n",
      "understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.\n",
      "You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in\n",
      "Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was\n",
      "reduced to the extremest indigence.”\n",

      "“But, upon my soul, I did _not_ know it,” he warmly replied; “I did not\n",

      "guessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her\n",
      "ignorance of the world—every thing was against me. The matter itself I\n",
      "could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was\n",
      "previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in\n",
      "general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,\n",
      "the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my\n",
      "present visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I\n",
      "might have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman! she\n",
      "offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could not\n",
      "be—and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house. The\n",
      "night following this affair—I was to go the next morning—was spent by\n",
      "me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The struggle\n",
      "was great—but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne, my thorough\n",
      "conviction of her attachment to me—it was all insufficient to outweigh\n",
      "that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false ideas of the\n",
      "necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and\n",
      "expensive society had increased. I had reason to believe myself secure\n",
      "of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself\n",
      "to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do. A\n",
      "heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave Devonshire;—I was\n",
      "engaged to dine with you on that very day; some apology was therefore\n",
      "necessary for my breaking this engagement. But whether I should write\n",
      "this apology, or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate. To\n",
      "see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted whether I\n",
      "could see her again, and keep to my resolution. In that point, however,\n",
      "I undervalued my own magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I\n",
      "saw her, and saw her miserable, and left her miserable—and left her\n",
      "hoping never to see her again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?” said Elinor, reproachfully; “a note\n",
      "would have answered every purpose. Why was it necessary to call?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was necessary to my own pride. I could not bear to leave the\n",
      "country in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the\n",
      "neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between\n",
      "Mrs. Smith and myself—and I resolved therefore on calling at the\n",
      "cottage, in my way to Honiton. The sight of your dear sister, however,\n",
      "was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone.\n",
      "You were all gone I do not know where. I had left her only the evening\n",
      "before, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right! A\n",
      "few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how\n",
      "happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to\n",
      "Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body! But in\n",
      "this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense\n",
      "of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling. Her sorrow,\n",
      "her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I was obliged\n",
      "to leave Devonshire so immediately—I never shall forget it—united too\n",
      "with such reliance, such confidence in me!—Oh, God!—what a hard-hearted\n",
      "rascal I was!”\n",

      "“I do not know what I told her,” he replied, impatiently; “less than\n",
      "was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more\n",
      "than was justified by the future. I cannot think of it.—It won’t\n",
      "do.—Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her\n",
      "kindness and confidence. Thank Heaven! it _did_ torture me. I was\n",
      "miserable. Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it\n",
      "gives me to look back on my own misery. I owe such a grudge to myself\n",
      "for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past\n",
      "sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now. Well, I\n",
      "went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was\n",
      "only indifferent. My journey to town—travelling with my own horses, and\n",
      "therefore so tediously—no creature to speak to—my own reflections so\n",
      "cheerful—when I looked forward every thing so inviting!—when I looked\n",
      "back at Barton, the picture so soothing!—oh, it was a blessed journey!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped.\n",
      "\n",

      "expressed; in a more simple one—perhaps too simple to raise any\n",
      "emotion—my feelings were very, very painful.—Every line, every word\n",
      "was—in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here,\n",
      "would forbid—a dagger to my heart. To know that Marianne was in town\n",
      "was—in the same language—a thunderbolt.—Thunderbolts and daggers!—what\n",
      "a reproof would she have given me!—her taste, her opinions—I believe\n",

      "Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what\n",
      "a sweet figure I cut! what an evening of agony it was! Marianne,\n",
      "beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in such a\n",
      "tone! Oh, God! holding out her hand to me, asking me for an\n",

      "Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a\n",
      "woman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read its contents.\n",

      "Her wretchedness I could have borne, but her passion—her malice—At all\n",
      "events it must be appeased. And, in short—what do you think of my\n",

      "happy thoughts and gentle diction. But what could I do!—we were\n",
      "engaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed—But I am\n",
      "talking like a fool. Preparation! Day! In honest words, her money was\n",
      "necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be done\n",
      "to prevent a rupture. And after all, what did it signify to my\n",
      "character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language\n",
      "my answer was couched? It must have been only to one end. My business\n",
      "was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or a\n",

      "in the same pocket-book, which was now searched by Madam with the most\n",

      "\n",
      "Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most\n",
      "worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited a\n",

      "tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged\n",
      "within herself—to his wishes than to his merits. She felt that his\n",
      "influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not\n",
      "in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction, that\n",
      "open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess;\n",
      "and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even\n",
      "innocent to indulge. But she felt that it was so, long, long before she\n",

      "Willoughby’s visit, Marianne’s safety, and her mother’s expected\n",
      "arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept\n",
      "off every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearful of betraying\n",
      "herself to her sister. Short was the time, however, in which that fear\n",
      "could affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby’s leaving\n",
      "the house, she was again called down stairs by the sound of another\n",
      "carriage.—Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment’s\n",
      "horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the hall, and reached the\n",
      "outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced\n",

      "overcome by her happiness, as she had been before by her fears. She was\n",
      "supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;\n",
      "and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to speak,\n",
      "embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at intervals to press\n",
      "Colonel Brandon’s hand, with a look which spoke at once her gratitude,\n",
      "and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the\n",

      "Elinor’s delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only\n",
      "checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep:\n",
      "but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when the life\n",
      "of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing her mother\n",
      "was near her, and conscious of being too weak for conversation,\n",
      "submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse\n",
      "around her. Mrs. Dashwood _would_ sit up with her all night; and\n",
      "Elinor, in compliance with her mother’s entreaty, went to bed. But the\n",
      "rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the most\n",
      "wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by irritation of\n",

      "his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now acquitted herself\n",
      "for having judged him so harshly before. But her promise of relating it\n",
      "to her sister was invariably painful. She dreaded the performance of\n",
      "it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be; doubted whether after\n",
      "such an explanation she could ever be happy with another; and for a\n",
      "moment wished Willoughby a widower. Then, remembering Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "reproved herself, felt that to _his_ sufferings and _his_ constancy far\n",
      "more than to his rival’s, the reward of her sister was due, and wished\n",
      "any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby’s death.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shock of Colonel Brandon’s errand at Barton had been much softened\n",

      "for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further\n",
      "intelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,\n",
      "that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away,\n",

      "Mrs. Dashwood’s looks and spirits proved her to be, as she repeatedly\n",
      "declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world. Elinor could\n",
      "not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes\n",
      "wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward. But Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment\n",
      "which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the exuberance of her joy to\n",

      "a danger in which, as she now began to feel, her own mistaken judgment\n",
      "in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had\n",
      "contributed to place her;—and in her recovery she had yet another\n",

      "characters, or feelings, could be given;—but her mother must always be\n",

      "pleased by it. But his coming for me as he did, with such active, such\n",

      "the case, would have prompted him. To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons,\n",
      "he has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect\n",
      "him; and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired, is very\n",
      "considerable; and so highly do _I_ value and esteem him, that if\n",
      "Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself.\n",
      "Marianne might at that moment be dying. But he did not ask for hope or\n",
      "encouragement. His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible\n",
      "effusion to a soothing friend, not an application to a parent. Yet\n",
      "after a time I _did_ say, for at first I was quite overcome, that if\n",

      "“To judge from the Colonel’s spirits, however, you have not yet made\n",

      "free, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a\n",
      "difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her. There,\n",
      "however, he is quite mistaken. His age is only so much beyond hers as\n",
      "to be an advantage, as to make his character and principles fixed; and\n",

      "favour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not so\n",
      "handsome as Willoughby; but at the same time, there is something much\n",
      "more pleasing in his countenance. There was always a something, if you\n",

      "be more solidly attaching to Marianne. Their gentleness, their genuine\n",
      "attention to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity is much\n",
      "more accordant with her real disposition, than the liveliness, often\n",
      "artificial, and often ill-timed of the other. I am very sure myself,\n",
      "that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he has proved\n",

      "heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding\n",
      "Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully\n",
      "assisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that she\n",

      "and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, and\n",
      "feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise\n",
      "to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young\n",

      "on both, without essential fatigue. Every thing that the most zealous\n",

      "was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward\n",
      "in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. To Elinor, the\n",
      "observation of the latter was particularly grateful. She, who had seen\n",
      "her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of\n",
      "heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to\n",
      "conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an\n",
      "apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted\n",

      "field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection,\n",
      "she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their\n",
      "notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. But here, Elinor could\n",
      "neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she assisted Marianne\n",
      "from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only an emotion\n",
      "too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity, and in\n",
      "its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole of her subsequent\n",
      "manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable\n",
      "exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room,\n",

      "firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of\n",
      "every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be\n",
      "connected.—She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,\n",

      "She went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an\n",
      "opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their\n",
      "favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his\n",
      "hand-writing.—That would not do.—She shook her head, put the music\n",
      "aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of\n",
      "feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring\n",
      "however with firmness as she did so, that she should in future practice\n",
      "much.\n",

      "The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms. On the\n",
      "contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked\n",
      "and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\n",
      "Margaret’s return, and talking of the dear family party which would\n",
      "then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the\n",
      "only happiness worth a wish.\n",

      "and am determined to enter on a course of serious study. Our own\n",
      "library is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyond\n",
      "mere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at the\n",

      "in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and\n",
      "virtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she\n",

      "she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of\n",

      "hill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned\n",
      "towards it, Marianne calmly said,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, exactly there,”—pointing with one hand, “on that projecting\n",
      "mound,—there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby.”\n",

      "satisfied on one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not\n",
      "_always_ acting a part, not _always_ deceiving me; but above all, if I\n",

      "of such designs, but what must it make me appear to myself? What in a\n",

      "very, very fickle.”\n",

      "of beginning her story directly, or postponing it till Marianne were in\n",
      "stronger health;—and they crept on for a few minutes in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not wishing him too much good,” said Marianne at last with a\n",

      "\n",
      "“They have borne more than our conduct. Do not, my dearest Elinor, let\n",
      "your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My illness\n",
      "has made me think. It has given me leisure and calmness for serious\n",
      "recollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was\n",
      "perfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own\n",
      "behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last\n",
      "autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of\n",
      "kindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my\n",
      "sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me\n",
      "to the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by\n",
      "myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the\n",
      "time to be wrong. Had I died, it would have been self-destruction. I\n",
      "did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such\n",
      "feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,—wonder\n",
      "that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for\n",
      "atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I\n",
      "died, in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my\n",
      "friend, my sister! You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my\n",
      "latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart! How should I\n",
      "have lived in _your_ remembrance! My mother too! How could you have\n",
      "consoled her! I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I\n",
      "looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing\n",
      "indulged. Every body seemed injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing\n",
      "kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt. To\n",
      "the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common\n",
      "acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart\n",
      "hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very\n",
      "attention. To John, to Fanny, yes, even to them, little as they\n",
      "deserve, I had given less than their due. But you, you above all, above\n",
      "my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your heart and\n",
      "its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?—not to any compassion\n",
      "that could benefit you or myself.—Your example was before me; but to\n",
      "what avail? Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I\n",
      "imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part\n",
      "in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which\n",
      "you had hitherto been left to discharge alone? No; not less when I knew\n",
      "you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn\n",
      "away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing\n",
      "sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only _that_ heart which had\n",
      "deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an\n",
      "unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,\n",
      "impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly\n",
      "that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well\n",
      "deserved. Marianne pressed her hand and replied,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very good.—The future must be my proof. I have laid down my\n",
      "plan, and if I am capable of adhering to it—my feelings shall be\n",
      "governed and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others, nor\n",
      "torture myself. I shall now live solely for my family. You, my mother,\n",
      "and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will share my\n",
      "affections entirely between you. From you, from my home, I shall never\n",
      "again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mix in other\n",
      "society, it will be only to show that my spirit is humbled, my heart\n",
      "amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser duties of\n",
      "life, with gentleness and forbearance. As for Willoughby—to say that I\n",
      "shall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle. His\n",
      "remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions.\n",
      "But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason,\n",
      "by constant employment.”\n",
      "\n",

      "impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at all\n",
      "nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as\n",
      "reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself\n",
      "leading to the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her\n",
      "anxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief\n",
      "points on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his\n",
      "repentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.\n",
      "Marianne said not a word.—She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the\n",
      "ground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. A\n",
      "thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge\n",
      "one. She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,\n",
      "unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister’s, and tears covered\n",
      "her cheeks.\n",

      "but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully\n",
      "minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could\n",
      "be safely indulged. As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a\n",
      "kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her\n",
      "tears, “Tell mama,” withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up\n",
      "stairs. Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as\n",
      "what she now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its\n",
      "result, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne\n",

      "feelings of the past could not be recalled.—Nothing could restore him\n",
      "with a faith unbroken—a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothing\n",
      "could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his\n",
      "means, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza. Nothing could\n",

      "Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby’s story from\n",
      "himself—had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence of\n",
      "his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion\n",
      "would have been greater. But it was neither in Elinor’s power, nor in\n",
      "her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed\n",
      "explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself. Reflection\n",
      "had given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of\n",
      "Willoughby’s deserts;—she wished, therefore, to declare only the simple\n",
      "truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his character,\n",
      "without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began\n",
      "voluntarily to speak of him again;—but that it was not without an\n",
      "effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for\n",
      "some time previously sitting—her rising colour, as she spoke,—and her\n",

      "\n",
      "“It is a great relief to me—what Elinor told me this morning—I have now\n",
      "heard exactly what I wished to hear.”—For some moments her voice was\n",
      "lost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness than\n",
      "before—“I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change. I never\n",
      "could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or later I\n",
      "must have known, all this.—I should have had no confidence, no esteem.\n",
      "Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know it—I know it,” cried her mother. “Happy with a man of libertine\n",
      "practices!—With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our\n",
      "friends, and the best of men!—No—my Marianne has not a heart to be made\n",
      "happy with such a man!—Her conscience, her sensitive conscience, would\n",
      "have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“You consider the matter,” said Elinor, “exactly as a good mind and a\n",
      "sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as\n",
      "well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,\n",
      "reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you\n",
      "in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have\n",
      "been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain.\n",
      "Had you married, you must have been always poor. His expensiveness is\n",
      "acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares that\n",
      "self-denial is a word hardly understood by him. His demands and your\n",
      "inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought\n",
      "on distresses which would not be the _less_ grievous to you, from\n",
      "having been entirely unknown and unthought of before. _Your_ sense of\n",
      "honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your\n",
      "situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear to you\n",
      "possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on\n",
      "your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it, but\n",
      "beyond that—and how little could the utmost of your single management\n",
      "do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage? Beyond\n",
      "_that_, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge _his_\n",
      "enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing on\n",
      "feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your own\n",
      "influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which had\n",
      "involved him in such difficulties?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne’s lips quivered, and she repeated the word “Selfish?” in a\n",
      "tone that implied—“do you really think him selfish?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The whole of his behaviour,” replied Elinor, “from the beginning to\n",
      "the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It was\n",
      "selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which\n",
      "afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of\n",
      "it, and which finally carried him from Barton. His own enjoyment, or\n",
      "his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is very true. _My_ happiness never was his object.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At present,” continued Elinor, “he regrets what he has done. And why\n",
      "does he regret it?—Because he finds it has not answered towards\n",
      "himself. It has not made him happy. His circumstances are now\n",
      "unembarrassed—he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only\n",
      "that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself. But\n",
      "does it follow that had he married you, he would have been happy?—The\n",
      "inconveniences would have been different. He would then have suffered\n",
      "under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed, he now\n",
      "reckons as nothing. He would have had a wife of whose temper he could\n",
      "make no complaint, but he would have been always necessitous—always\n",
      "poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable\n",
      "comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,\n",
      "even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not a doubt of it,” said Marianne; “and I have nothing to\n",
      "regret—nothing but my own folly.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Not a syllable passed aloud. They all waited in silence for the\n",

      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for\n",

      "from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not knowing\n",

      "spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as\n",

      "Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted\n",
      "the room, and walked out towards the village—leaving the others in the\n",

      "what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined\n",

      "profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one\n",
      "of the happiest of men. His situation indeed was more than commonly\n",
      "joyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell\n",
      "his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any reproach\n",
      "to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his misery, from\n",

      "despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire. He was\n",
      "brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to happiness;—and\n",
      "the change was openly spoken in such a genuine, flowing, grateful\n",

      "the modesty with which he rated his own deserts, and the politeness\n",
      "with which he talked of his doubts, he did not, upon the whole, expect\n",
      "a very cruel reception. It was his business, however, to say that he\n",
      "_did_, and he said it very prettily. What he might say on the subject a\n",

      "\n",
      "That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of\n",
      "malice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to\n",

      "even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a\n",
      "want of liberality in some of her opinions—they had been equally\n",

      "reached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,\n",
      "good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself. Nothing but such\n",
      "a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement,\n",
      "which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother’s\n",
      "anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him.\n",
      "\n",

      "her the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was\n",
      "renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend in\n",
      "the world to assist me. In such a situation as that, where there seemed\n",
      "nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature, how\n",
      "could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted on sharing\n",
      "my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but the most\n",
      "disinterested affection was her inducement? And even now, I cannot\n",
      "comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage it could\n",
      "be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest\n",
      "regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world. She could\n",
      "not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour;\n",
      "that your own family might in time relent. And at any rate, she lost\n",
      "nothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it\n",
      "fettered neither her inclination nor her actions. The connection was\n",
      "certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration\n",
      "among her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would\n",
      "be better for her to marry _you_ than be single.”\n",
      "\n",

      "another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the\n",
      "consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred\n",
      "as my honour. I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only\n",
      "friendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and\n",
      "Lucy, I did not know how far I was got. After that, I suppose, I _was_\n",
      "wrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I\n",
      "reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than\n",
      "these:—The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but\n",
      "myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor smiled, and shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon’s being expected at the\n",
      "Cottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him,\n",
      "but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented\n",
      "his giving him the living of Delaford—“Which, at present,” said he,\n",
      "“after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion,\n",
      "he must think I have never forgiven him for offering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "_Now_ he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the\n",
      "place. But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed\n",
      "all his knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the\n",
      "parish, condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor\n",
      "herself, who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard it\n",
      "with so much attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "One question after this only remained undecided, between them, one\n",
      "difficulty only was to be overcome. They were brought together by\n",
      "mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;\n",
      "their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness\n",
      "certain—and they only wanted something to live upon. Edward had two\n",
      "thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all\n",
      "that they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite\n",
      "enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year\n",
      "would supply them with the comforts of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his\n",
      "mother towards him; and on _that_ he rested for the residue of their\n",
      "income. But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would still\n",
      "be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had been spoken\n",
      "of in Mrs. Ferrars’s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his\n",
      "chusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert’s offence would serve no\n",
      "other purpose than to enrich Fanny.\n",
      "\n",
      "About four days after Edward’s arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to\n",
      "complete Mrs. Dashwood’s satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of\n",
      "having, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company\n",
      "with her than her house would hold. Edward was allowed to retain the\n",
      "privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every\n",
      "night to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned\n",
      "in the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers’ first tête-à-tête\n",
      "before breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "A three weeks’ residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at\n",
      "least, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between\n",
      "thirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind\n",
      "which needed all the improvement in Marianne’s looks, all the kindness\n",
      "of her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother’s language, to\n",
      "make it cheerful. Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he\n",
      "did revive. No rumour of Lucy’s marriage had yet reached him:—he knew\n",
      "nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were\n",
      "consequently spent in hearing and in wondering. Every thing was\n",
      "explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice\n",
      "in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the\n",
      "interest of Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good\n",
      "opinion of each other, as they advanced in each other’s acquaintance,\n",
      "for it could not be otherwise. Their resemblance in good principles and\n",
      "good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably have\n",
      "been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other\n",
      "attraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters\n",
      "fond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,\n",
      "which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letters from town, which a few days before would have made every\n",
      "nerve in Elinor’s body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read\n",
      "with less emotion than mirth. Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful\n",
      "tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour\n",
      "forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure, had\n",
      "quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by all accounts,\n",
      "almost broken-hearted, at Oxford. “I do think,” she continued, “nothing\n",
      "was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called\n",
      "and sat a couple of hours with me. Not a soul suspected anything of the\n",
      "matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul! came crying to me the day\n",
      "after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not\n",
      "knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her\n",
      "money before she went off to be married, on purpose we suppose to make\n",
      "a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world; so I\n",
      "was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter,\n",
      "where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess, in\n",
      "hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again. And I must say\n",
      "that Lucy’s crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is\n",
      "worse than all. Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot get him out of my head, but\n",
      "you must send for him to Barton, and Miss Marianne must try to comfort\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood’s strains were more solemn. Mrs. Ferrars was the most\n",
      "unfortunate of women—poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility—and\n",
      "he considered the existence of each, under such a blow, with grateful\n",
      "wonder. Robert’s offence was unpardonable, but Lucy’s was infinitely\n",
      "worse. Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars;\n",
      "and even, if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son, his\n",
      "wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter, nor be permitted to\n",
      "appear in her presence. The secrecy with which everything had been\n",
      "carried on between them, was rationally treated as enormously\n",
      "heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred to the\n",
      "others, proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage;\n",
      "and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy’s\n",
      "engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled, than that she\n",
      "should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family. He\n",
      "thus continued:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward’s name, which does not\n",
      "surprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been\n",
      "received from him on the occasion. Perhaps, however, he is kept silent\n",
      "by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a\n",
      "line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper\n",
      "submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shown to\n",
      "her mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars’s heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be\n",
      "on good terms with her children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of\n",
      "Edward. It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not\n",
      "exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A letter of proper submission!” repeated he; “would they have me beg\n",
      "my mother’s pardon for Robert’s ingratitude to _her_, and breach of\n",
      "honour to _me?_ I can make no submission. I am grown neither humble nor\n",

      "“You may certainly ask to be forgiven,” said Elinor, “because you have\n",
      "offended;—and I should think you might _now_ venture so far as to\n",
      "profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew\n",
      "on you your mother’s anger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He agreed that he might.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be\n",
      "convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent\n",
      "in _her_ eyes as the first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a\n",
      "letter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him,\n",
      "as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by\n",
      "word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing\n",
      "to Fanny, he should go to London, and personally intreat her good\n",
      "offices in his favour. “And if they really _do_ interest themselves,”\n",
      "said Marianne, in her new character of candour, “in bringing about a\n",

      "was admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. For many years of\n",

      "feared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him off\n",
      "as rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was\n",
      "revealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss\n",
      "Dashwood, by every argument in her power;—told him, that in Miss Morton\n",
      "he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;—and enforced\n",
      "the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a\n",
      "nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only the\n",
      "daughter of a private gentleman with no more than _three;_ but when she\n",
      "found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation,\n",
      "he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she judged it wisest,\n",
      "from the experience of the past, to submit—and therefore, after such an\n",
      "ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity, and as served to\n",
      "prevent every suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree of consent\n",
      "to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to\n",
      "be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now\n",
      "her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\n",
      "inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest\n",
      "objection was made against Edward’s taking orders for the sake of two\n",
      "hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for\n",
      "the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had\n",
      "been given with Fanny.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by\n",
      "Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,\n",
      "seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\n",
      "\n",
      "With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,\n",
      "they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the\n",
      "living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with\n",
      "an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making\n",
      "considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their\n",
      "completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments\n",
      "and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\n",
      "as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying\n",
      "till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton\n",
      "church early in the autumn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the\n",
      "Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the\n",
      "Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;—could\n",
      "chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep. Mrs. Jennings’s\n",
      "prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for\n",
      "she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by\n",
      "Michaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really\n",
      "believed, one of the happiest couples in the world. They had in fact\n",
      "nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,\n",
      "and rather better pasturage for their cows.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations\n",
      "and friends. Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was\n",
      "almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the\n",
      "expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,” said John, as\n",
      "they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford\n",
      "House, “_that_ would be saying too much, for certainly you have been\n",
      "one of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is. But, I\n",
      "confess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon\n",
      "brother. His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in\n",
      "such respectable and excellent condition! And his woods,—I have not\n",
      "seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in\n",
      "Delaford Hanger! And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly the\n",
      "person to attract him, yet I think it would altogether be advisable for\n",
      "you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel\n",
      "Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may happen;\n",
      "for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of anybody\n",
      "else,—and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage,\n",
      "and so forth. In short, you may as well give her a chance: you\n",
      "understand me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But though Mrs. Ferrars _did_ come to see them, and always treated them\n",
      "with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by\n",
      "her real favour and preference. _That_ was due to the folly of Robert,\n",
      "and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many\n",
      "months had passed away. The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had\n",
      "at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of\n",
      "his deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous\n",
      "attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was\n",
      "given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and\n",
      "re-established him completely in her favour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole of Lucy’s behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which\n",
      "crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance\n",
      "of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however\n",
      "its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every\n",
      "advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and\n",
      "conscience. When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately\n",
      "visited her in Bartlett’s Buildings, it was only with the view imputed\n",
      "to him by his brother. He merely meant to persuade her to give up the\n",
      "engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\n",
      "of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle\n",
      "the matter. In that point, however, and that only, he erred; for though\n",
      "Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in\n",
      "_time_, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to\n",
      "produce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered in her mind when\n",
      "they parted, which could only be removed by another half hour’s\n",
      "discourse with himself. His attendance was by this means secured, and\n",
      "the rest followed in course. Instead of talking of Edward, they came\n",
      "gradually to talk only of Robert,—a subject on which he had always more\n",
      "to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an interest\n",
      "even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily evident to\n",
      "both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother. He was proud of his\n",
      "conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of marrying\n",
      "privately without his mother’s consent. What immediately followed is\n",
      "known. They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish; for she\n",
      "had many relations and old acquaintances to cut—and he drew several\n",
      "plans for magnificent cottages;—and from thence returning to town,\n",
      "procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of\n",
      "asking it, which, at Lucy’s instigation, was adopted. The forgiveness,\n",
      "at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert; and\n",
      "Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have\n",
      "transgressed none, still remained some weeks longer unpardoned. But\n",
      "perseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self-condemnation\n",
      "for Robert’s offence, and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated\n",
      "with, procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its\n",
      "graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest\n",
      "state of affection and influence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never\n",
      "cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor,\n",
      "though superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken of as an\n",
      "intruder, _she_ was in every thing considered, and always openly\n",
      "acknowledged, to be a favourite child. They settled in town, received\n",
      "very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms\n",
      "imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies and\n",
      "ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy, in which their\n",
      "husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent domestic\n",
      "disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed\n",
      "the harmony in which they all lived together.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have\n",
      "puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to\n",
      "it, might have puzzled them still more. It was an arrangement, however,\n",
      "justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever\n",
      "appeared in Robert’s style of living or of talking to give a suspicion\n",
      "of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving his\n",
      "brother too little, or bringing himself too much;—and if Edward might\n",
      "be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular,\n",
      "from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and from the\n",
      "regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no less\n",
      "contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor’s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well\n",
      "be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,\n",
      "for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with\n",
      "her. Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure\n",
      "in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing\n",
      "Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though\n",
      "rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It was now her\n",
      "darling object. Precious as was the company of her daughter to her, she\n",
      "desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her\n",
      "valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was\n",
      "equally the wish of Edward and Elinor. They each felt his sorrows, and\n",
      "their own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the\n",
      "reward of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "With such a confederacy against her—with a knowledge so intimate of his\n",
      "goodness—with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself, which at\n",
      "last, though long after it was observable to everybody else—burst on\n",
      "her—what could she do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to\n",
      "discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her\n",
      "conduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an\n",
      "affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment\n",
      "superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give\n",
      "her hand to another!—and _that_ other, a man who had suffered no less\n",
      "than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years\n",
      "before, she had considered too old to be married,—and who still sought\n",
      "the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\n",
      "\n",
      "But so it was. Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible\n",
      "passion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with\n",
      "expecting,—instead of remaining even for ever with her mother, and\n",
      "finding her only pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in\n",
      "her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,—she found\n",
      "herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new\n",
      "duties, placed in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the\n",
      "patroness of a village.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,\n",
      "believed he deserved to be;—in Marianne he was consoled for every past\n",
      "affliction;—her regard and her society restored his mind to animation,\n",
      "and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own\n",
      "happiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of\n",
      "each observing friend. Marianne could never love by halves; and her\n",
      "whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had\n",
      "once been to Willoughby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his\n",
      "punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of\n",
      "Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as\n",
      "the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he\n",
      "behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy\n",
      "and rich. That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its own\n",
      "punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;—nor that he long thought\n",
      "of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret. But that he\n",
      "was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or contracted an\n",
      "habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must not be\n",
      "depended on—for he did neither. He lived to exert, and frequently to\n",
      "enjoy himself. His wife was not always out of humour, nor his home\n",
      "always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs, and in\n",
      "sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic\n",
      "felicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Marianne, however, in spite of his incivility in surviving her\n",
      "loss, he always retained that decided regard which interested him in\n",
      "every thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of\n",
      "perfection in woman; and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him\n",
      "in after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without\n",
      "attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an\n",
      "age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being\n",
      "supposed to have a lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication\n",
      "which strong family affection would naturally dictate; and among the\n",
      "merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked\n",
